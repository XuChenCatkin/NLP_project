    "Task:\n",
    "Extract all, relationships(bewteen nodes and Nodes; between nodes and special things), to build a knowledge graph and return as a json format. Focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Dictionary: $nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Magical thingsDictionary: $special\n",
    "\n",
    "You should follow the instructions step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the text: read the text carefully and understand what this text is talking about, identifies main events that mentioned in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify Nodes: Through your understanding and your knowledge about Harry Potter, trying to find out nodes that in this text, **Notice** all the nodes should be in Normal Dictionary and Magical Dictionary, return the exact name and id in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Predicting Nodes: for the content give,based on your knowledge about Harry Potter try to predict the nodes that might be mentioned in the text by (e.g., context, appearence, clothes or indirect references), **Notice** all the nodes should be in Normal Dictionary and Magical Dictionary, return the exact name and id in the dictionary, prefix these Nodes with \"Pred_\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sequence Construction: for the nodes you found in step 2 and 3, try to build several sequences of nodes such that:\n",
    "        a. One list could only represent one event that identified in step 1, and the event should be in chronological order.\n",
    "        b. The sequence should be like this: [node1, node2, node3, ...], and the nodes should be in the same time and space.\n",
    "        c. If the sequence diverges into multiple branches, you should record all branches.\n",
    "            example of diverge sequence: [node1, node2, node3,] -branch1-> [ node4, node5] \n",
    "                                                                -branch2-> [ node6, node7]\n",
    "            return [node1, node2, node3, node4, node5] and [node1, node2, node3, node6, node7]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Extract High-Quality Relationships (edges): for the every sequnce that captured in step 3, try to extract the relationships between nodes:\n",
    "        a. the relationships should be meaningful actions attitudes, or other interactions, and the relationships should be between nodes and nodes,\n",
    "        b. if there's no relationship between nodes, you should add none,\n",
    "        d. **Notice** the relationship should be mentioned clearly in the text.\n",
