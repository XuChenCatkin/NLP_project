He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. \"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.",
        "Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life. \"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\" 'Course,\" said Hagrid.",
        "Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who's inner circle.\" Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they didn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. \"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. ...\" said Harry. \"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich,\" said Fred. \"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" said George. \"But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house. ...\"\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?",
        "She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving. \"Whose forest is it now, human?\" bellowed Bane. \"Filthy half-breeds!\" she screamed, her hands still tight over her head. \"Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!\" \"Be quiet!\" shouted Hermione, but it was too late - Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, \"Incarcerous!\"",
        "Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur's torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged. Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage. \"Nooooo!\" he heard Umbridge shriek. \"Noooooo ... I am Senior Undersecretary ... you cannot ... unhand me, you animals ... nooooo!\" He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun one of them - then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry's heart leapt, if he could just reach it -\nBut as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur's hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half. \"Now!\" roared a voice in Harry's ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright; Hermione too had been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and heads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them. \"And these?\"",
        "said Ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed. \"I mean - he hasn't died, has he?\" \"No, no, he's breathing,\" whispered Hermione, taking the Cauldron Cake Harry passed her. He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin's presence in their compartment had its uses. Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first train journey to Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy's bidding. They were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.",
        "He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" A magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.",
        "\"It's awful -\"\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head. \"What's up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent's nose or something?\" Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.",
        "Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair. \"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn't supposed to be used for animal transformations!\" \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron. \"You'll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily. \"It's okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We'll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. ...\"\nIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Wait till everyone finds out you've got a tail!\"",
        "Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat. \"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke them.\" As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover. \"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies.\" Seamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror.",
        "\"Draco Malfoy,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for ... well ...\"\n\"No problem,\" said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \"I can fix your nose if you stand still.\" Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes. \"Episkey,\" said Tonks. Harry's nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.",
        "Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different.",
        "Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle.",
        "\"We didn't - lose?\" \"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square ... even Wood admits it.\" \"Where is Wood?\" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.",
        "Sir, I -\"\n\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\" Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\" \"How long have I been in here?\" \"Three days.",
        "Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \"Can't you - ?\" \"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"",
        "Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:\nMINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE\nSCOOPS GRAND PRIZE\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \"We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\" The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend. Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn't show it) with flaming-red hair.",
        "Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys' kitchen fire. \"Did he eat it?\" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his feet. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, straightening up. \"What was it?\" \"Ton-Tongue Toffee,\" said Fred brightly. \"George and I invented them, and we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer. ...\"\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.",
        "His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet - they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers. The water didn't feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. ... Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths. Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque. Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron - nor, thankfully, the giant squid. Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass.",

        "Hermione's hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air. \"Yes?\" said Moody, looking at her. \"Avada Kedavra,\" Hermione whispered. Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron. \"Ah,\" said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. \"Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra ... the Killing Curse.\" He put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody's fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface. Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding. \"Avada Kedavra!\" Moody roared. There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him. Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.",
        "Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this. \"You know what this means?\" Black said abruptly to Harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel. \"Turning Pettigrew in?\" \"You're free,\" said Harry. \"Yes ... ,\" said Black. \"But I'm also - I don't know if anyone ever told you - I'm your godfather.\" \"Yeah, I knew that,\" said Harry. \"Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian,\" said Black stiffly.",
        "He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother's charm does that already. What he's really done is to stop you getting out of here safely. \"Second problem: You're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.\" \"I don't -\"\n\"The Trace, the Trace!\" said Mad-Eye impatiently.",
        "\"Draco Malfoy,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for ... well ...\"\n\"No problem,\" said Tonks, without smiling.

Harry's nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.",
        "Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. \"I - I didn't see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \"I didn't know it was called that, sir.\" \"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" \"It - well - it shows me my family -\"\n\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\" \"How did you know - ?\" \"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" Harry shook his head. \"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want ... whatever we want ...\"\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.",
        "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is - it's Devil's Snare!\" \"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.",
        "There was no time to relax that night - they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for Transfiguration next day. Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories. He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall. They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall. \"Oh bravo!\" cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. \"Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...\"\nHe leaned forward a little.",
        "\"Why don't we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it's a bit cold, isn't it? You don't have to talk to Ron!\" she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence. The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves. It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions.",
        "Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office door. \"What are you doing?\" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from Filch. \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\" \"Hogsmeade,\" said Harry, in a would-be casual voice. \"Ah,\" said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \"Why don't you come in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.\" \"A what?\" said Harry. He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water.",
        "A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers. \"Water demon,\" said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. \"We shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.\" The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner.",
        "\"Well then, why are you out of class?\" \"It's urgent, apparently,\" said the second gargoyle snidely. \"I'm looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,\" Harry explained. \"It's my owl, she's injured.\" \"Injured owl, did you say?\" Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall's shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Yes,\" said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, \"she turned up after the other post owls and her wing's all funny, look -\"\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched. \"Hmm,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked. \"Looks like something's attacked her. Can't think what would have done it, though. ... Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid's got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls ...\"\nHarry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, \"Do you know how far this owl's traveled, Potter?\" \"Er,\" said Harry. \"From London, I think.\" He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood \"London\" to mean \"number twelve, Grimmauld Place\" by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle. Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig's wing closely.",
        "\"The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\" Blank shock showed in Voldemort's face for a moment, but then it was gone. \"But what does it matter?\" he said softly. \"Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone ... and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. ...\"\n\"But you're too late,\" said Harry. \"You've missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.\" Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.",
        "\"Oh, all right. Harry, come here.\" For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door. \"C'mon.\" \"Why?\" Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. \"Descendo,\" muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet.",
        "\"We can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,\" his face split into a gormless grin, \"you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What's a die-dum?\" \"Harry?\" Ron's voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry's right. \"Are you talking to someone?\" With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, \"Descendo!\"",
        "It had a number three around its neck. He didn't even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground. Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs. \"Well, there you are!\" said Bagman. \"You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I'm going to have to leave you in a moment, because I'm commentating.",
        "Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing noise. Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers. \"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What's my rat got to do with anything?\" \"That's not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly. \"What d'you mean - of course he's a rat -\"\n\"No, he's not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He's a wizard.\" \"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"",
        "Of course, Justin's been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he'd been down for Eton. That's not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin's heir on the loose, is it?\" \"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously. \"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.\" There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, \"Remember what was written on the wall?",
        "\"It was a very, very close call last night,\" said Hermione. \"I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!\" The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully. \"If she'd caught Snuffles ...\"\nHarry finished the sentence for her. \"He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.\"",
        "Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed. The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him - but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House. He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too - the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion. Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place. \"Ah, look, boys, it's the champion,\" he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \"Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he's going to be around much longer. ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ... how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task's my bet.\"",
        "No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently -\n\"Stop it!\" Hermione said shrilly. Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified. Moody raised his wand. The spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch. \"Reducio,\" Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.",
        "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"",
        "\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle. \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this - can this be - ?\" The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter ... what an honor.\" He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\" Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.",
        "\"You said you'd already worked out that egg clue!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"Keep your voice down!\" said Harry crossly. \"I just need to - sort of fine-tune it, all right?\" He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm.",
        "The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:\nDUMBLEDORE - THE TRUTH AT LAST? Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end? The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside.",
        "Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes - he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up. Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face if he could see where Harry was now. There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were \"Special Effects\" sweets: Drooble's Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\"breathe fire for your friends! \"), Ice Mice (\"hear your teeth chatter and squeak! \"), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\"hop realistically in the stomach! \"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons. Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES).",
        "\"Do I have to?\" Lupin smiled but made no answer. \"Come here, boy,\" said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward him with his wand. \"I need to Disillusion you.\" \"You need to what?\" said Harry nervously. \"Disillusionment Charm,\" said Moody, raising his wand. \"Lupin says you've got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won't stay on while we're flying; this'll disguise you better.",
        "Here you go -\"\nHe rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck. \"Nice one, Mad-Eye,\" said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry's midriff. Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon. \"Come on,\" said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand. They all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon's beautifully kept lawn. \"Clear night,\" grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens.",
        "I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry - yer a wizard.\" There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \"I'm a what?\" gasped Harry. \"A wizard, o' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.\" Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\nof WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf.",
        "\"As I was saying,\" he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \"we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\" \"You're JOKING!\" said Fred Weasley loudly. The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody's arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.",
        "\"I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,\" he said, \"though now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar ...\"\nProfessor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly. \"Er - but maybe this is not the time ... no ...\" said Dumbledore, \"where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament ... well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely. \"The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks.",
        "Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" The giant chuckled. \"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. \"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\"",
        "Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy's shell. One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last -\nThe sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. ... They moved Voldemort's body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.",
        "Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\" \"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly.",
        "Good luck, all of you.\" Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.",
        "\"Mount your brooms, please.\" Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too -\"\n\"JORDAN!\" \"Sorry, Professor.\" The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes - Flint flying like an eagle up there - he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and - OUCH - that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger - Quaffle taken by the Slytherins - that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger - sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which - nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes - she's really flying - dodges a speeding Bludger - the goal posts are ahead - come on, now, Angelina - Keeper Bletchley dives - misses - GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\" Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \"Budge up there, move along.\"",
        "So tell me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.\" Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter's heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, \"I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one's used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.\" \"Aaaah.\" Dumbledore's sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment. \"That was clever. ... There is a pair, I take it?\" \"In Borgin and Burkes,\" said Malfoy, \"and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the cabinet was traveling between them, but he couldn't make anyone hear him.",
        "Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories. \"What are Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?\" Harry asked as they climbed. Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn't. \"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's room,\" said Ron quietly. \"Great long price lists for stuff they've invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they'd been inventing all that ...\"\n\"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,\" said Ginny. \"We thought they just liked the noise.\"",
        "No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently -\n\"Stop it!\" Hermione said shrilly. Harry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified. Moody raised his wand. The spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch. \"Reducio,\" Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.",

Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.",
        "I just want to get inside Honeydukes!\" \"What's that?\" said Hermione. \"It's this sweetshop,\" said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, \"where they've got everything. ... Pepper Imps - they make you smoke at the mouth - and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you're thinking what to write next -\"\n\"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?\" Hermione pressed on eagerly. \"In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack's supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain -\"\n\"- and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you're sucking them,\" said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying. Hermione looked around at Harry. \"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?\"",
        "She raised her wand. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \"What've you done to him?\"",
        "\"You said you'd already worked out that egg clue!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"Keep your voice down!\" said Harry crossly. \"I just need to - sort of fine-tune it, all right?\" He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm.",
        "Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom ... and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle. Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's leg, its pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry's robes, and were attempting to drag him down. \"Relashio!\" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.",
        "He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. \"Let's stay here for now,\" Harry said. Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. \"Where are you going?\" asked Ron. \"If we're staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,\" she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. \"Salvio Hexia ... Protego Totalum ... Repello Muggletum ... Muffliato ... You could get out the tent, Harry. ...\"\n\"Tent?\" \"In the bag!\" \"In the ... of course,\" said Harry. He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm.",
        "You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I'm sure we can lend you some scales, and we've got a small stock of old books here, they'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. ...\"\nSlughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment's foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales. \"Now then,\" said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \"I've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of 'em, even if you haven't made 'em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\" He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.",
        "He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching. Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it. \"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\"",
        "Harry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho's eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron's knight. \"What's - er - going on with you and her anyway?\" Ron asked quietly. \"Nothing,\" said Harry truthfully. \"I - er - heard she's going out with someone else now,\" said Hermione tentatively. Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all.",
        "I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\" Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.",
        "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. \"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course - I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" \"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.",
        "\"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,\" said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. \"Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you -\"\n\"That's great!\" said Harry, relief surging through him. \"Griphook, thank you, we're really -\"\n\"- in return,\" said the goblin firmly, \"for payment.\" Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. \"How much do you want? I've got gold.\" \"Not gold,\" said Griphook. \"I have gold.\"",
        "yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor -\n\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres -\nHarry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them -\n\"Colloportus!\"",
        "gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where - where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face.",
        "You-Know-Who was one.\" \"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\" \"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid. They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.",
        "\"The what?\" said Harry. He could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror. \"The Grim, my dear, the Grim!\" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn't understood.",
        "\"The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen - the worst omen - of death!\" Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts - the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent ... Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair.",
        "\"Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!\" \"Why?\" said Harry curiously. \"Because it is a room that a person can only enter,\" said Dobby seriously, \"when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs.",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.",
        "\"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, its all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that - no? Well, if you're sure - better be GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet.",
        "He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground. \"STUPEFY!\" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness -\n\"Stop!\" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That's my son!\" Harry's hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher.",
        "Ron was clenching Crabbe's gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\" \"Oh, yeah ... whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They're probably still in Azkaban.\" \"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled. \"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief. \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you'd be going backward.\" He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he's got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\" Harry tried to force Goyle's dull face into a look of concern. \"Yeah ...\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn't find much. Father's got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we've got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor -\"\n\"Ho!\"",
        "I just want to get inside Honeydukes!\" \"What's that?\" said Hermione. \"It's this sweetshop,\" said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, \"where they've got everything. ... Pepper Imps - they make you smoke at the mouth - and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you're thinking what to write next -\"\n\"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?\" Hermione pressed on eagerly. \"In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack's supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain -\"\n\"- and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you're sucking them,\" said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying. Hermione looked around at Harry. \"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?\"",
        "They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins. \"Ah, right,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Better get cracking then.\" He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one. \"Incendio!\" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him. Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever. \"Off you go then, Fred,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Coming,\" said Fred. \"Oh no - hang on -\"\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction - big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers. Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying \"the Burrow!\" Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp.",
        "\"Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\" She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once. \"It's nothing,\" he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \"It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.\" \"But you're doing what it says?\" \"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -\"\n\"Ginny's got a point,\" said Hermione, perking up at once. \"We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\" \"Hey!\" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. \"Specialis Revelio!\" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \"Finished?\"",
        "He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. \"You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?\" Ron muttered to Harry. Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, \"Specialis Revelio!\" over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class.",
        "\"Right then - let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\" He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously. \"Easy, now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink. ... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much.",
        "...\"\nHarry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. \"Tha's it,\" said Hagrid. \"Tha's it, Harry ... now, bow ...\"\nHarry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up. The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move. \"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right - back away, now, Harry, easy does it -\"\nBut then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow. \"Well done, Harry!\" said Hagrid, ecstatic.",
        "Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again. \"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\"",
        "He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go. Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs. They reached the dark landing. \"Nox,\" they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod. Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.",
        "\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood - I've found you a Seeker.\" Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \"Are you serious, Professor?\" \"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" Harry nodded silently.",
        "\"Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn't know how! She'd need a wand, for a start!\" \"And she had one,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"I found her holding one, Ludo. If it's all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she's got to say for herself.\" Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, \"Rennervate!\" Winky stirred feebly.",
        "\"When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one ... two ... three -\"\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\": His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\" A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing. \"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\" and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep. \"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge. \"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.",
        "Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then -\nHe had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence.",
        "\"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there ... well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. ... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\"",
        "There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year. SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2\nby Miranda Goshawk\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's. \"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too!\" he said. \"The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a witch.\" At this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.",
        "\"Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what it is - come on now - let's get outta here.\" The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury. \"A fine example to set for your children ... brawling in public ... what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought -\"\n\"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity -\"\nBut it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley's face. Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn't his favorite way to travel.",
        "\"Oh,\" said Ron, the smile fading from his face. \"Yeah ...\"\n\"So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?\" Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig. \"Just a couple of people,\" Hermione repeated, checking her watch and then looking anxiously toward the door. \"I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh look, this might be them now -\"\nThe door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people. First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise. \"A couple of people?\" said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. \"A couple of people?\" \"Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,\" said Hermione happily.",
        "Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff's cup, hooking it onto the blade. \"Impervius!\" screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal. Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. Harry seized Griphook's fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. \"Liberacorpus!\" yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry's hand.",
        "Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb. \"Right-o,\" Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley's back was turned he pocketed it with a wink. \"We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snack-boxes,\" George told Harry under his breath. Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, \"What are Skiving Snackboxes?\" \"Range of sweets to make you ill,\" George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley's back. \"Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They're double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you've been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half -\"\n\" '- which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.' That's what we're putting in the adverts, anyway,\" whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley's line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket.",
        "\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature. \"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don't want to be rude or anything, but - this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\" Aunt Petunia's high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head.",
        "He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. She appealed to Ron. \"You don't believe in this, do you?\" Harry looked up. Ron hesitated.",
        "... They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione's flat disbelief nor Ron's persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry's belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes. \"Obsession?\" said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. \"We're not the ones with an obsession, Harry! We're the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\" But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives. ... master of Death ... Why didn't Ron and Hermione understand?\n\"",
        "A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\" \"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.",
        "\"Potter!\" Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready. \"I've had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!\" \"I know, we're evacuating,\" Harry said, \"Voldemort's -\"\n\"- attacking because they haven't handed you over, yeah,\" said Aberforth, \"I'm not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you've just sent to safety.",
        "\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" \"Horrible - well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.\" \"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left - Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.",
        "Harry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys' kitchen fire. \"Did he eat it?\" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his feet. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, straightening up. \"What was it?\" \"Ton-Tongue Toffee,\" said Fred brightly. \"George and I invented them, and we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer. ...\"\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.",
        "The others laughed. \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me - he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned - but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced - all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here - they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult -\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -\"). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.",
        "However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron's head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry's mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron's left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left. \"What's happened to him?\" \"Splinched,\" said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron's sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest. Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron's shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this ... His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron's upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. \"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany' -\"\n\"Bag - right -\"\nHarry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes -\n\"Quickly!\" He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. \"Accio Dittany!\" A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids. \"He's fainted,\" said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. \"Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.\" Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh. \"Wow,\" said Harry. \"It's all I feel safe doing,\" said Hermione shakily. \"There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren't try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. ... He's lost so much blood already. ...\"\n\"How did he get hurt? I mean\" - Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place - \"why are we here?",
        "They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:\nMessrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\nPurveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers\nare proud to present\nThe Marauder's Map\nIt was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else. This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead -\n\"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\" - he pointed them out - \"but we're sure we're the only ones who know about these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it's caved in - completely blocked.",
        "\"Gits ...\"\nHermione returned from Hagrid's just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees. \"So?\" said Ron, looking up when she entered. \"Got all his lessons planned for him?\" \"Well, I tried,\" she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which began to steam as they dried out. \"He wasn't even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came stumping out of the forest -\"\nHarry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. \"What's he keeping in there?",
        "...\"\n\"I'm surprised so many people could see them,\" said Ron. \"Three in a class -\"\n\"Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,\" said a malicious voice nearby. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were walking along right behind them. \"D'you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you'd be able to see the Quaffle better?\" He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of \"Weasley Is Our King.\" Ron's ears turned scarlet. \"Ignore them, just ignore them,\" intoned Hermione, pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses. December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth years. Ron and Hermione's prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached.",
        "\"Good to see you!\" Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table. \"Journey all right, Harry?\" Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. \"Mad-Eye didn't make you come via Greenland, then?\" \"He tried,\" said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. \"Oh no - sorry -\"\n\"Here, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley's charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building. Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill's heavily laden arms. \"This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,\" she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates. Bill took out his wand, muttered \"Evanesco!\"",
        "and the scrolls vanished. \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Sirius. \"You've met Mundungus, haven't you?\" The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake. \"Some'n say m' name?\"",
        "He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. \"Let's stay here for now,\" Harry said. Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet. \"Where are you going?\" asked Ron. \"If we're staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,\" she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. \"Salvio Hexia ... Protego Totalum ... Repello Muggletum ... Muffliato ... You could get out the tent, Harry. ...\"\n\"Tent?\" \"In the bag!\" \"In the ... of course,\" said Harry. He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm.",
        "He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list. A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley. The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy. Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop. The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\" Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\" \"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter. \"What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?\" said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year.",
        "\"No, my Lord ... never, my Lord ...\"\nWormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. ... Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay ... but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\" \"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me -\"\n\"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\"",
        "\"Don't you lie to me!\" Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George's pocket and said, \"Accio!\" Several small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George's pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley's outstretched hand. \"We told you to destroy them!\" said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. \"We told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!\" It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all. \"Accio! Accio!",
        "He raised his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go. Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs. They reached the dark landing. \"Nox,\" they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod. Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.",
        "Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different.",
        "\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves - this was a big mistake. \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door - and it was locked. \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts. \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\"",
        "The lock clicked and the door swung open - they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" \"Say 'please.' \"\n\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" \"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \"All right - please.\" \"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\"",
        "Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them - we'll be able to see if it's true.\" \"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived.",
        "Nobody answered. \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely.",
        "\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\"",
        "Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat.",
        "\"Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\" She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once. \"It's nothing,\" he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \"It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.\" \"But you're doing what it says?\" \"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -\"\n\"Ginny's got a point,\" said Hermione, perking up at once. \"We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\" \"Hey!\" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. \"Specialis Revelio!\" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \"Finished?\"",
        "said Harry irritably. \"Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?\" \"It seems all right,\" said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. \"I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.\" \"Good. Then I'll have it back,\" said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor. Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs. This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.",
        "For the rest of the week's Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince's instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage's, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harry's abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \"official\" instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince's. Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself. \"Or herself,\" said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening.",
        "He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes. \"Hmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, \"this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I'm much mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I ... however ...\"\nHe lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes. \"Yes ... hornbeam and dragon heartstring?\" he shot at Krum, who nodded. \"Rather thicker than one usually sees ... quite rigid ... ten and a quarter inches ... Avis!\" The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight.",
        "They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt. \"Hello?\" called Harry. There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision. \"Who's there?\" he said. And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell. \"MORSMORDRE!\" And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky. \"What the - ?\" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.",
        "\"No you're not,\" said Ginny sharply. \"Neville Longbottom - Luna Lovegood. Luna's in my year, but in Ravenclaw.\" \"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure,\" said Luna in a singsong voice. She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle. The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray clouds. \"Guess what I got for my birthday?\" said Neville.",
        "Gringotts. Run by goblins.\" Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \"Goblins?\" \"Yeah - so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe - 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you - gettin' things from Gringotts - knows he can trust me, see. \"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\"",
        "I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.\" Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore. \"Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.\" A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror.",
        "he asked Lupin. \"A dementor,\" said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. \"One of the dementors of Azkaban.\" Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket. \"Eat,\" he repeated. \"It'll help.",
        "Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. \"Your name's Longbottom?\" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again. Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move. \"The Cruciatus Curse,\" said Moody. \"Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\" he said, pointing his wand at the spider. \"Engorgio!\" The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody's desk as possible. Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \"Crucio!\" At once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side.",
        "The Stinksap vanished. \"Sorry,\" said Neville again, in a small voice. Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage. \"I'm starving,\" said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog's head, and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning. \"Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,\" said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. \"Boy and girl from each.\" \"And guess who's a Slytherin prefect?\" said Ron, still with his eyes closed. \"Malfoy,\" replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.\n\" 'Course,\" said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another. \"And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,\" said Hermione viciously. \"How she got to be a prefect when she's thicker than a concussed troll ...\"\n\"Who's Hufflepuff?\" Harry asked. \"Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,\" said Ron thickly. \"And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,\" said Hermione. \"You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,\" said a vague voice.",
        "Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. \"Your name's Longbottom?\" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again.

Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \"Crucio!\" At once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side.",
        "Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight. Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight. Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n\" 'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but ...\"\nHis voice trailed away hopefully. They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together. Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. \"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\"",
        "and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. \"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"I'd light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something. ...\"\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. \"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\"",
        "...\"\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of them disappeared. Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered. \"Ron!\" said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered \"Reparo!\" and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door. \"Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we don't.",
        "But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who'd opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut.",
        "Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" The giant chuckled. \"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. \"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\"",
        "Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too. Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes. It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain. \"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer.",
        "For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him - then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it. \"Do you know what this is, Potter?\" Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again. \"No,\" said Harry, with complete honesty this time. \"It is Veritaserum - a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\" said Snape viciously. \"Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips\" - he shook the crystal bottle slightly - \"right over your evening pumpkin juice.",
        "\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they're - dead.\" Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \"Lily and James ... I can't believe it ... I didn't want to believe it ... Oh, Albus ...\"\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know ... I know ...\" he said heavily. Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all.",
        "In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin. \"Look at the state of his robes,\" Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. \"He dresses like our old house-elf.\" But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds. Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes.",
        "...\"\nThey went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (\"Local Deliveries Only\"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry's hand. Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece. The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden. \"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,\" said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it. \"I asked Nearly Headless Nick ... he says he's heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut. ...\"\nHarry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.",
        "The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. \"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said you'd go to the deathday party.\" So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.",
        "She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived. \"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too - never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\" It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.",
        "Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it - Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap.",
        "\"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\" \"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!\" Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.",
        "Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents. All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent. \"We'll be a bit cramped,\" he called, \"but I think we'll all squeeze in. Come and have a look.\" Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen.",
        "He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom. \"Ready?\" said Lupin, gripping the box lid. \"Ready,\" said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened. \"Go!\" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry -\n\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum!",
        "\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to - everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\"",
        "\"So - anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?\" \"Bowtruckles,\" said Hermione. \"They're tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees.\" \"Five points for Gryffindor,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank.",
        "So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit.\" As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again. Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened. Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones. He had removed them. Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased.",
        "But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be packing,\" she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor. \"Oh - yeah,\" said Harry, grabbing up a few more books. \"Don't be stupid, it'll be much quicker if I - pack!\" cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor. Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk. \"It's not very neat,\" said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. \"My mum's got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly - she even gets the socks to fold themselves - but I've never mastered how she does it - it's a kind of flick -\"\nShe flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry's socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within. \"Ah, well,\" said Tonks, slamming the trunk's lid shut, \"at least it's all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too - Scourgify -\" She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage; a few feathers and droppings vanished.",
        "\"I was saying, what are those horse things?\" Harry said, as he, Ron, and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting. \"What horse things?\" \"The horse things pulling the carriages!\" said Harry impatiently; they were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look. \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking about - look!\" Harry grabbed Ron's arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-face with the winged horse.",
        "Hagrid looked a little confused. \"Er - thestrals!\" he said loudly. \"Big - er - winged horses, yeh know!\" He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard, \" 'has ... to ... resort ... to ... crude ... sign ... language ...' \"\n\"Well ... anyway ...\" said Hagrid, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered. \"Erm ... what was I sayin'?\" \" 'Appears ... to ... have ... poor ... short ... term ... memory ...' \" muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her.",
        "\"When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one ... two ... three -\"\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\": His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he'd been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\" A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing. \"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry's knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\" and the next second Harry's legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep. \"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge. \"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry's feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.",
        "Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\n\"Sectum - !\" Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\n\"No, Potter!\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore. \"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so ...",
        "He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless ... He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father - what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London?",
        "\"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.\" Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one.",
        "\"What we'd need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it's us.\" \"But that's impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed. \"No, it's not,\" said Hermione. \"All we'd need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\" \"What's that?\" said Ron and Harry together. \"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago -\"\n\"D'you think we've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron.",
        "\"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything.",
        "\"He looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway ...\" He turned to Harry. \"What were you going to tell us?\" Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he'd finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally lowered them to say, \"Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry ... you'll have to be really, really careful. Don't go looking for trouble, Harry -\"\n\"I don't go looking for trouble,\" said Harry, nettled. \"Trouble usually finds me.\" \"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\"",
        "At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky's had been, like a toga. Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed. \"Winky, sir!\" he said. Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire.",
        "He had just found an incantation (\"Sectumsempra!\") scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words \"For Enemies,\" and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.",
        "Let me!\" \"REPARO!\" There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height -\nIn desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: He had but a split second's relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in. \"I'm comin', Harry!\" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him -\nThen the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat -\n\"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!\" A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike's seat and found himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, \"Confringo!\" He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. \"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" moaned Hagrid, \"I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it meself - yeh've got no room -\"\n\"It's not a problem, just keep flying!\" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer. As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike - Stan -\n\"Expelliarmus!\" Harry yelled. \"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!\" The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike's engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. \"Harry, what's happened?\"",
        "\"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!\" As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione -\nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar -\nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, \"Confringo!\" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair.",
        "\"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol's fault at first -\"\n\"Who's Errol?\" \"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\"\n\"Who?\"",
        "\"Only let's make it stand for Dumbledore's Army because that's the Ministry's worst fear, isn't it?\" There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this. \"All in favor of the D.A.?\" said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. \"That's a majority - motion passed!\"",
        "Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" The giant chuckled. \"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. \"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\"",
        "Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. \"Your name's Longbottom?\" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again. Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move. \"The Cruciatus Curse,\" said Moody. \"Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\" he said, pointing his wand at the spider. \"Engorgio!\" The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody's desk as possible. Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \"Crucio!\" At once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side.",
        "Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward. \"Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come ... nothing to worry about, it's just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment -\"\n\"Wand weighing?\" Harry repeated nervously.",
        "There were no doors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.\n\" 'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,' \" Harry read. \"How're we supposed to get up there?\" As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet. \"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first. He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups. Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all talking in whispers.",
        "- but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention. \"These're nifflers,\" said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. \"Yeh find 'em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. ... There yeh go, look.\" One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson's watch off her wrist.",
        "\"Yeah, go on ...\"\n\"It's all right,\" said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach's dark interior. \"You're not going mad or anything. I can see them too.\" \"Can you?\" said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide, silvery eyes. \"Oh yes,\" said Luna, \"I've been able to see them ever since my first day here.",
        "They've always pulled the carriages. Don't worry. You're just as sane as I am.\" Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.",
        "Snape, however, remained standing. \"Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,\" said Snape. Harry didn't say anything. \"He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley - apparently alone.\" Still, Harry didn't speak. \"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?\" Harry tried to look mildly surprised. \"I don't know, Professor.\" Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink. \"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition.",
        "Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?\" \"No,\" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious. \"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\" There was a long silence. \"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,\" said Harry. \"If he's seeing things like -\"\n\"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\"",
        "He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground. \"STUPEFY!\" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness -\n\"Stop!\" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That's my son!\" Harry's hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher.",
        "\"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained. \"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light - speedy - we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.\" \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. ...\"\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"",
        "Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them. \"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\" \"I wouldn't bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth. \"One - two - three -\"\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor. Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he's all right?\" she squealed through her fingers. \"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together. Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.",
        "Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight. Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight. Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n\" 'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but ...\"\nHis voice trailed away hopefully. They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together. Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. \"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\"",
        "Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves. And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. \"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel. \"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. \"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. \"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away. ...\"\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. \"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder. They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving. \"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.",
        "Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more. A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses. He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or - something else. \"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter -\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light -\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying.",
        "He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos!\" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway.",
        "Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \"Lumos!\" A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks. \"Get out of here!\" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. \"See?\" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again.",
        "Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned. Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours. Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:\nLevicorpus (nvbl)\nWhile the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl ... that had to mean \"nonverbal.\" Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A.",
        "\"Professor,\" Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, \"Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\" \"- Protego Horribilis - the diadem of Ravenclaw?\" squeaked Flitwick. \"A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!\" \"I only meant - do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?\" \"Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy!\" Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? \"We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!\"",
        "\"Oh - right - sorry,\" he muttered, taking the quill back. \"Er ... good luck on Tuesday,\" she said. \"I really hope you do well.\" Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid\nHermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn't yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation. \"Stunningly pretty? Her?\" Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita's article had appeared. \"What was she judging against - a chipmunk?\" \"Ignore it,\" Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn't hear them.",
        "Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin ... Justin must've seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again ... and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror - and -\"\nRon's jaw had dropped. \"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly. Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.",
        "People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor. \"Harry!\" Hermione said warningly. \"Go on, then, Potter,\" Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. \"Moody's not here to look after you now - do it, if you've got the guts -\"\nFor a split second, they looked into each other's eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted. \"Furnunculus!\" Harry yelled. \"Densaugeo!\" screamed Malfoy. Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles - Harry's hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy's hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up - Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth. \"Hermione!\"",
        "His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet - they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers. The water didn't feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. ... Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths. Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque. Small fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron - nor, thankfully, the giant squid. Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass.",
        "They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins. \"Ah, right,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Better get cracking then.\" He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one. \"Incendio!\" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him. Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever. \"Off you go then, Fred,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Coming,\" said Fred. \"Oh no - hang on -\"\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction - big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers. Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying \"the Burrow!\" Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp.",
        "\"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\" \"And how do you conjure it?\" \"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\" Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick. \"Right,\" he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach. \"The incantation is this -\" Lupin cleared his throat.",
        "\"Expecto patronum!\" \"Expecto patronum,\" Harry repeated under his breath, \"expecto patronum.\" \"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?\" \"Oh - yeah -\" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride. \"Expecto patrono - no, patronum - sorry - expecto patronum, expecto patronum -\"\nSomething whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas. \"Did you see that?\" said Harry excitedly. \"Something happened!\" \"Very good,\" said Lupin, smiling.",
        "There's nothing written in his diary.\" But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered. She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\" Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.",
        "\"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.",
        "\"Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?\" \" 'Please' always helps,\" said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:\n\"Obscuro!\" A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus's clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain. \"What - how dare - what are you - ?\" \"I'm very sorry, Professor Black,\" said Hermione, \"but it's a necessary precaution!\" \"Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?\"",
        "Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door. \"Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it's us going down to Hagrid's!\" \"Are you telling me,\" Harry whispered, \"that we're here in this cupboard and we're out there too?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. \"I'm sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people ... and we're walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -\"\nShe broke off, still listening intently. \"We've gone down the front steps. ...\"\nHermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few questions answered. \"Where did you get that hourglass thing?\" \"It's called a Time-Turner,\" Hermione whispered, \"and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my studies.",
        "Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly. \"It's all right, Crookshanks,\" Hermione cooed through the wickerwork. \"I'll let you out on the train.\" \"You won't,\" snapped Ron. \"What about poor Scabbers, eh?\" He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket. Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck his head inside. \"They're here,\" he said. \"Harry, come on.\" Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.",
        "He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it - Neville needed a leg up - and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.",
        "The Stinksap vanished. \"Sorry,\" said Neville again, in a small voice. Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage. \"I'm starving,\" said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog's head, and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning. \"Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,\" said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. \"Boy and girl from each.\" \"And guess who's a Slytherin prefect?\" said Ron, still with his eyes closed. \"Malfoy,\" replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.\n\" 'Course,\" said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another. \"And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,\" said Hermione viciously. \"How she got to be a prefect when she's thicker than a concussed troll ...\"\n\"Who's Hufflepuff?\" Harry asked. \"Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,\" said Ron thickly. \"And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,\" said Hermione. \"You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,\" said a vague voice.",
        "he demanded. But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action. \"Wait here,\" he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said, \"Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?\" Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes. \"Yes, all right then,\" she said finally, blushing furiously. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, in relief.",
        "He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. \"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.\" Hagrid dropped the teapot. \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \"Fluffy?\"",
        "They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night. \"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve -\"\nThe conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples. \"What were you doin' down there?\" said Stan, dropping his professional manner.",
        "Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes - he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up. Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face if he could see where Harry was now. There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned; along yet another wall were \"Special Effects\" sweets: Drooble's Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\"breathe fire for your friends! \"), Ice Mice (\"hear your teeth chatter and squeak! \"), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\"hop realistically in the stomach! \"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons. Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES).",
        "Gringotts. Run by goblins.\" Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \"Goblins?\" \"Yeah - so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe - 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you - gettin' things from Gringotts - knows he can trust me, see. \"Got everythin'? Come on, then.\"",
        "\"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart. Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground. Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\" He raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate!\" The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb.",
        "Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. \"Hippogriffs!\" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \"Beau'iful, aren' they?\" Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. \"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer -\"\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously. \"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,\" said Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. \"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,\" Hagrid continued. \"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow, then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt. \"Right - who wants ter go first?\" Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being tethered like this. \"No one?\"",
        "THREE.\" There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig's cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and higher they climbed into the sky -\nAnd then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, oblivious -\nScreams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees -\n\"No - HEDWIG!\"",
        "Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face. \"No!\" shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore's glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. \"No,\" said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, \"no, you're not dead, you said it wasn't poison, wake up, wake up - Rennervate!\" he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledore's chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. \"Rennervate - sir - please -\"\nDumbledore's eyelids flickered; Harry's heart leapt. \"Sir, are you - ?\" \"Water,\" croaked Dumbledore. \"Water,\" panted Harry. \"Yes -\"\nHe leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it. \"Aguamenti!\" he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand. The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips - but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. \"But I had some - wait - Aguamenti!\" said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore's mouth, the water vanished again. \"Sir, I'm trying, I'm trying!\" said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing.",
        "\"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\" It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron. \"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see -\"\n\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point.\"",
        "\"It was a very, very close call last night,\" said Hermione. \"I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!\" The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully. \"If she'd caught Snuffles ...\"\nHarry finished the sentence for her. \"He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.\"",
        "But quiet ... I think I hear Nagini. ...\"\nAnd the second man's voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure. And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway.",
        "He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright. Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer - What was he to do? The only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him -\nBut before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap. There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. ... This man could talk to snakes. Frank didn't understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.",
        "He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale -\"\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns's every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest. \"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ...\n\"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\"",
        "- but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention. \"These're nifflers,\" said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. \"Yeh find 'em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. ... There yeh go, look.\" One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson's watch off her wrist.",
        "Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, \"Imperio!\" The spider leapt from Moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance. Everyone was laughing - everyone except Moody. \"Think it's funny, do you?\" he growled. \"You'd like it, would you, if I did it to you?\" The laughter died away almost instantly.",
        "said Ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed. \"I mean - he hasn't died, has he?\" \"No, no, he's breathing,\" whispered Hermione, taking the Cauldron Cake Harry passed her. He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin's presence in their compartment had its uses. Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first train journey to Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy's bidding. They were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.",
        "At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang - back.\" Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\" He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.",
        "\"My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\" mumbled Neville. \"Take Charms,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\" Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville's face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville. Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination. \"He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\" said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. \"The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\" Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen. \"So, Potter, Potter ...\" said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \"Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration ... all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven't you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?\" \"It was, but you told me I had to get an 'Outstanding' in my O.W.L., Professor.\" \"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T students with 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I didn't buy the books or any ingredients or anything -\"\n\"I'm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Very well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way - twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.",
        "Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn't working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table. Cedric still didn't know about the dragons ... the only champion who didn't, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum. ...\n\"Hermione, I'll see you in the greenhouses,\" Harry said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. \"Go on, I'll catch you up.\" \"Harry, you'll be late, the bell's about to ring -\"\n\"I'll catch you up, okay?\" By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn't want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter's article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim. \"Diffindo!\" Cedric's bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed. \"Don't bother,\" said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him. \"Tell Flitwick I'm coming, go on. ...\"\nThis was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric's friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric. \"Hi,\" said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink.",
        "Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what's happen - no - no, I don't like it - no, stop - stop -\"\nBut the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it'll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor - then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY!\"",
        "\"One - two - three - Legilimens!\" A hundred dementors were swooping toward Harry across the lake in the grounds. ... He screwed up his face in concentration. ... They were coming closer. ... He could see the dark holes beneath their hoods ... yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him, his eyes fixed upon Harry's face, muttering under his breath. ... And somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were growing fainter ...\nHarry raised his own wand. \"Protego!\"",
        "Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.",
        "Now everyone's attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames. \"The champion for Beauxbatons,\" said Dumbledore, \"is Fleur Delacour!\" \"It's her, Ron!\" Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables. \"Oh look, they're all disappointed,\" Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. \"Disappointed\" was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms. When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next ...\nAnd the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment. \"The Hogwarts champion,\" he called, \"is Cedric Diggory!\" \"No!\"",
        "Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro. \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!\"",
        "said Ron. \"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!\" \"But this isn't soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him. Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side. \"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\" Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \"So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating -\"\n\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall. \"I mean, after that open and revolting foul -\"\n\"Jordan, I'm warning you -\"\n\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\"",
        "It was time for the rescuer to appear - but no one was coming to help this time -\nAnd then it hit him - he understood. He hadn't seen his father - he had seen himself -\nHarry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" he yelled. And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors. ... Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness. ... They were gone. The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water.",
        "It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him. ... It stopped on the bank.",
        "They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night. \"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve -\"\nThe conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples. \"What were you doin' down there?\" said Stan, dropping his professional manner.",
        "Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows. \"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,\" he said, \"and I am sure he will perform it admirably.\" Neville's face went, if possible, even redder. Snape's lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap. \"Now, then,\" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall. \"Nothing to worry about,\" said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm. \"There's a boggart in there.\" Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. \"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks - I've even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice. \"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?\" Hermione put up her hand. \"It's a shape-shifter,\" she said.",
        "\"It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.\" \"Couldn't have put it better myself,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. \"So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears. \"This means,\" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's small sputter of terror, \"that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\" Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go. \"Er - because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it should be?\" \"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed.",
        "\"It's always best to have company when you're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake - tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening. \"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.",
        "\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\" Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.",
        "Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different.",
        "Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle.",
        "Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\n\"Sectum - !\" Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\n\"No, Potter!\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore. \"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so ...",
        "Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: He was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.",
        "Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore turned to the dais too. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. ...\nAnd Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing - Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second. ... But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled, \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again. ... But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There's nothing you can do, Harry -\"\n\"Get him, save him, he's only just gone through!\" \"It's too late, Harry -\"\n\"We can still reach him -\"\nHarry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. ...\n\"There's nothing you can do, Harry ... nothing. ... He's gone.\"",
        "\"Let's see,\" said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. \"I've been packing for days, so we're ready to leave at a moment's notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye's whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron's mum's nose. \"I've also modified my parents' memories so that they're convinced they're really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life's ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That's to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me - or you, because unfortunately, I've told them quite a bit about you. \"Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I'll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don't - well, I think I've cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don't know that they've got a daughter, you see.",
        "\"Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\" She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once. \"It's nothing,\" he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \"It's not like, you know, Riddle's diary. It's just an old textbook someone's scribbled on.\" \"But you're doing what it says?\" \"I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there's nothing funny -\"\n\"Ginny's got a point,\" said Hermione, perking up at once. \"We ought to check that there's nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\" \"Hey!\" said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand. \"Specialis Revelio!\" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared. \"Finished?\"",
        "He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done. \"You sure the Prince hasn't got any tips?\" Ron muttered to Harry. Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, \"Specialis Revelio!\" over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class.",
        "\"... I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo',\" Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. \"But thanks fer offerin', Hermione. ... It means a lot. ...\"\nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more. \"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,\" he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. \"Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners -\"\n\"We couldn't have done,\" said Hermione. \"We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer.",
        "It was in the Daily Prophet.\" \"Ar, well then,\" said Hagrid. \"There's no way yeh could've done it. ... I'm sorry I've bin - yeh know - I've jus' bin worried abou' Aragog ... an' I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin' yeh -\"\nAt which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful. \"I'm starving,\" said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. \"And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner. ...\"\nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione's arm and held her back.",
        "It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice. \"You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\" \"So ... so will you move, please?\"",
        "\"Captains shake hands,\" she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. \"Mount your brooms. On the whistle ... three ... two ... one ...\"\nThe whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away. Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator's started up.",
        "\"I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?\" asked Parvati, smirking. It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning. \"Not really,\" said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet.",
        "\"It was a very, very close call last night,\" said Hermione. \"I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!\" The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully. \"If she'd caught Snuffles ...\"\nHarry finished the sentence for her. \"He'd probably be back in Azkaban this morning.\"",
        "\"What else could I do with it?\" Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore's will.\n\" 'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.' \"\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places.",
        "\"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\" \"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!\" Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.",
        "\"This way, Harry,\" breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase. They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird's call, a soft, musical voice said, \"Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?\" \"Hmm ... What do you think, Harry?\"",
        "Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. \"I - I didn't see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \"I didn't know it was called that, sir.\" \"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" \"It - well - it shows me my family -\"\n\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\" \"How did you know - ?\" \"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" Harry shook his head. \"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want ... whatever we want ...\"\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.",
        "he demanded. But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action. \"Wait here,\" he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said, \"Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?\" Parvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes. \"Yes, all right then,\" she said finally, blushing furiously. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, in relief.",
        "\"Come in here. ...\"\nHe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry. \"Early Christmas present for you, Harry,\" he said. Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George's jokes, stared at it. \"What's that supposed to be?\" \"This, Harry, is the secret of our success,\" said George, patting the parchment fondly. \"It's a wrench, giving it to you,\" said Fred, \"but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours.\" \"Anyway, we know it by heart,\" said George. \"We bequeath it to you. We don't really need it anymore.\" \"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?\" said Harry. \"A bit of old parchment!\" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. \"Explain, George.\" \"Well ... when we were in our first year, Harry - young, carefree, and innocent -\"\nHarry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent. \"- well, more innocent than we are now - we got into a spot of bother with Filch.\" \"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason -\"\n\"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual -\"\n\"- detention -\"\n\"- disembowelment -\"\n\"- and we couldn't help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.\" \"Don't tell me -\" said Harry, starting to grin. \"Well, what would you've done?\" said Fred. \"George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed - this.\" \"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know,\" said George. \"We don't reckon Filch ever found out how to work it.",
        "\"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol's fault at first -\"\n\"Who's Errol?\" \"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes -\"\n\"Who?\"",
        "\"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\" said Fred from the front. \"But Percy wouldn't lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he needed him.\" \"Percy's been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George, frowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room. ... I mean, there's only so many times you can polish a prefect badge. ... You're driving too far west, Fred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.",
        "screamed Mrs. Weasley. Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed. Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley. \"Protego!\" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of \"Harry!\" \"HE'S ALIVE!\" were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. \"I don't want anyone else to try to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call.",
        "Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail. Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore's pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames. Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn't see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor. The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber. \"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn't do anything - he just caught fire -\"\nTo Harry's astonishment, Dumbledore smiled. \"About time, too,\" he said. \"He's been looking dreadful for days; I've been telling him to get a move on.\" He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry's face. \"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.",
        "The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither - vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves. \"Where's Pig?\" said Ron's voice, right behind Harry.",
        "\"Good to see you!\" Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table. \"Journey all right, Harry?\" Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. \"Mad-Eye didn't make you come via Greenland, then?\" \"He tried,\" said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. \"Oh no - sorry -\"\n\"Here, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley's charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building. Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill's heavily laden arms. \"This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,\" she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates. Bill took out his wand, muttered \"Evanesco!\"",
        "and the scrolls vanished. \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Sirius. \"You've met Mundungus, haven't you?\" The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake. \"Some'n say m' name?\"",
        "said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. \"But you said -\"\n\"Professor Snape, meanwhile,\" said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it carried over all the muttering, \"will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\" \"No!\" said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn't it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?",
        "As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath. \"What's that?\" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand. \"Dunno ...\"\nHarry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look.",
        "\"I don't believe it,\" he said hoarsely. It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail. \"Who sent it to you?\"",
        "\"Right before you go into the lake, sir - gillyweed!\" \"What's it do?\" said Harry, staring at the gillyweed. \"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!\" \"Dobby,\" said Harry frantically, \"listen - are you sure about this?\" He couldn't quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to \"help\" him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm. \"Dobby is quite sure, sir!\" said the elf earnestly. \"Dobby hears things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task. ... Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!\" Harry's doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels. \"Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!\" Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.",
        "\"My bag just split ... brand-new and all ...\"\n\"Cedric,\" said Harry, \"the first task is dragons.\" \"What?\" said Cedric, looking up. \"Dragons,\" said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. \"They've got four, one for each of us, and we've got to get past them.\" Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he'd been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric's gray eyes. \"Are you sure?\" Cedric said in a hushed voice.",
        "Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \"Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\" he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \"that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\" \"It's liquid luck,\" said Hermione excitedly.",
        "\"It makes you lucky!\" The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighten Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention. \"Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it's a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\" said Slughorn. \"Desperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off.\"",
        "Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\" There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible.",
        "... Come on, we'd better get going. ...\"\nHe pulled out the Marauder's Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the Fat Lady's portrait. \"That was really, really good, Harry,\" said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry, and Ron left. \"Yeah, it was!\" said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. \"Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?\" \"Only once,\" said Hermione, stung. \"I got you loads more than you got me -\"\n\"I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times -\"\n\"Well, if you're counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand -\"\nThey argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder's Map, but he was also thinking of how Cho had said he made her nervous. ...",
        "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is - it's Devil's Snare!\" \"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.",
        "\"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. \"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare ... what did Professor Sprout say? - it likes the dark and the damp -\"\n\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \"Yes - of course - but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\"",
        "\"Draco Malfoy,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for ... well ...\"\n\"No problem,\" said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \"I can fix your nose if you stand still.\" Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes. \"Episkey,\" said Tonks. Harry's nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.",
        "Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause -\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \"Bones, Susan!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \"Boot, Terry!\" \"RAVENCLAW!\" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.",
        "He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. \"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.\" Hagrid dropped the teapot. \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \"Fluffy?\"",
        "\"Yeah - he's mine - bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the -\"\n\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Now, don't ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That's top secret, that is.\" \"But Snape's trying to steal it.\"",
        "\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus-pocus' - I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -\"\n\"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm. \"It'll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.",
        "\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to - everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\"",
        "At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang - back.\" Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\" He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.",
        "...\"\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of them disappeared. Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered. \"Ron!\" said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered \"Reparo!\" and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door. \"Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we don't.",
        "\"As I was saying,\" he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \"we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\" \"You're JOKING!\" said Fred Weasley loudly. The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody's arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.",
        "\"Harry?\" But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. ...\nAnd then, with a gasp, he remembered -\n\"Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\" His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. \"My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric's Hollow. ...\" Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \"He's my ancestor! I'm descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\"",
        "For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. \"Severus ... please ...\"\nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. \"Avada Kedavra!\" A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.",
        "Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.\" \"Yes, yes, fine,\" said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug. Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment's hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around. The Prime Minister's first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times. \"How do you do?\" said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand. Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes. \"Fudge told you everything?\"",
        "It's the nearest we'll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll like.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor. \"So ...\" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry - well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.\" \"How does it work?\" said Harry nervously. \"Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin, \"which is a kind of anti-dementor - a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\" Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon - hope, happiness, the desire to survive - but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\" \"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously.",
        "\"He don' know his own strength!\" said Hagrid earnestly. \"An' he's gettin' better, he's not fightin' so much anymore -\"\n\"So this is why it took you two months to get home!\" said Hermione distractedly. \"Oh Hagrid, why did you bring him back if he didn't want to come, wouldn't he have been happier with his own people?\" \"They were all bullyin' him, Hermione, 'cause he's so small!\" said Hagrid. \"Small?\" said Hermione. \"Small?\" \"Hermione, I couldn' leave him,\" said Hagrid, tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard. \"See - he's my brother!\" Hermione simply stared at him, her mouth open. \"Hagrid, when you say 'brother,' \" said Harry slowly, \"do you mean - ?\" \"Well - half-brother,\" amended Hagrid. \"Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an' she went an' had Grawp here -\"\n\"Grawp?\" said Harry. \"Yeah ... well, tha's what it sounds like when he says his name,\" said Hagrid anxiously. \"He don' speak a lot of English. ... I've bin tryin' ter teach him. ... Anyway, she don' seem ter have liked him much more'n she liked me.",
        "When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren't many people left now. \"Moon\" ... , \"Nott\" ... , \"Parkinson\" ... , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" ... , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" ... , and then, at last -\n\"Potter, Harry!\" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.",
        "Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed. The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray - though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him - but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House. He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too - the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion. Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid's cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place. \"Ah, look, boys, it's the champion,\" he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \"Got your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he's going to be around much longer. ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ... how long d'you reckon you're going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task's my bet.\"",
        "\"I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.\" \"Er,\" said Harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort. \"At these times,\" said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, \"I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.\" \"You mean ... that stuff's your thoughts?\" Harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin. \"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Let me show you.\"",
        "\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves - this was a big mistake. \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door - and it was locked. \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts. \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\"",
        "The lock clicked and the door swung open - they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" \"Say 'please.' \"\n\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" \"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \"All right - please.\" \"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\"",
        "Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don't leave me!\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents? Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth.",
        "Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:\n\"Kill him.\" The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing -\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood - the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming -\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars -\nHe couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers -\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony. \"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD!",
        "Nobody answered. \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely.",
        "\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old House, you know.\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\"",
        "But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour ... every hour. ... We shall see.\" Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes passed in silence.",
        "...\nThen, before Harry's very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw. Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man's face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction. Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore's Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent ... but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older. ...",
        "There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them. \"Crouch!\" Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. \"Barty Crouch!\" \"Good heavens,\" said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor. Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape's legs. Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek. \"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\" She flung herself forward onto the young man's chest. \"You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master's son!\" \"He is simply Stunned, Winky,\" said Dumbledore.",
        "\"What are you looking for, boy?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \"You'd better get out, then. Go on - out!\" Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.",
        "Mrs. Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, \"Let's get out of here.\" \"Shouldn't we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly. \"Trust me,\" said Ron.",
        "Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories. \"What are Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?\" Harry asked as they climbed. Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn't. \"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's room,\" said Ron quietly. \"Great long price lists for stuff they've invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they'd been inventing all that ...\"\n\"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,\" said Ginny. \"We thought they just liked the noise.\"",
        "Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on. \"All I am saying,\" said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, \"is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.\" \"Right,\" said Harry as Bill opened the door, \"yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind.\" As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.",
        "Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom ... and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle. Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry's leg, its pointed fangs bared - Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry's robes, and were attempting to drag him down. \"Relashio!\" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. ... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.",
        "yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor -\n\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres -\nHarry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them -\n\"Colloportus!\"",
        "\"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn't matter!\" said a man's voice. \"There are other ways in - WE'VE GOT THEM, THEY'RE HERE!\" Harry spun around.",
        "They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna - Neville - help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door. \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall - then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, \"Collo - aaaaaaaaargh ...\"\nHe turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy -\n\"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling.",
        "Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable - he's the Slytherin ghost.\" Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.",
        "cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognized as Dumbledore's predecessor, Armando Dippet. \"Shame on you, Phineas!\" \"Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?\" called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod. \"Oh, very well,\" said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand slightly apprehensively, \"though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he's done most of the family -\"\n\"Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas's voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. \"You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?\" \"Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,\" recited Phineas in a bored voice. \"Yes, yes ... very well. ...\"\nHe sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred, George, and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night things. \"Harry - what's going on?\" asked Ginny, who looked frightened. \"Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt -\"\n\"Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,\" said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. \"He has been taken to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius's house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than the Burrow.",
        "The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle-borns. ... Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle's memories wiped from it. Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise. ...\"\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. \"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly. And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.",
        "And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. \"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\" said Harry. Lucius Malfoy rounded on him. \"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said. \"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry.",
        "Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different.",
        "Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \"Can't you - ?\" \"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"",
        "\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you - you're Nearly Headless Nick!\" \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted. \"Like this,\" he said irritably.",
        "...\"\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of them disappeared. Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered. \"Ron!\" said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered \"Reparo!\" and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door. \"Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we don't.",
        "Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. \"Hippogriffs!\" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \"Beau'iful, aren' they?\" Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. \"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer -\"\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously. \"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,\" said Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. \"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,\" Hagrid continued. \"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow, then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt. \"Right - who wants ter go first?\" Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being tethered like this. \"No one?\"",
        "\"Right then - let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\" He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously. \"Easy, now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink. ... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much.",
        "choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. \"They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!\" A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor. \"I couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow!\" choked Hagrid. \"All on his own! At Christmas.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about what he called \"interesting creatures\" and other people called \"terrifying monsters.\" On the other hand, there didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak.",
        "Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too. Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken's egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione's. Pipes. It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain. \"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer.",
        "said Parvati. \"She's going with someone else.\" Parvati looked astonished. \"Ooooh - who?\" she said keenly. Harry shrugged. \"No idea,\" he said. \"So what about Ron?\" \"Well ...\" said Parvati slowly, \"I suppose my sister might ... Padma, you know ... in Ravenclaw. I'll ask her if you like.\" \"Yeah, that would be great,\" said Harry. \"Let me know, will you?\" And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil's nose was dead center.",
        "\"You - er - look nice,\" he said awkwardly. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall,\" she added to Ron. \"Right,\" said Ron, looking around. \"Where's Hermione?\"",
        "Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. \"Your name's Longbottom?\" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again. Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move. \"The Cruciatus Curse,\" said Moody. \"Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\" he said, pointing his wand at the spider. \"Engorgio!\" The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody's desk as possible. Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \"Crucio!\" At once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side.",
        "Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them - we'll be able to see if it's true.\" \"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived.",
        "\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to - everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\"",
        "Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight. Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight. Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n\" 'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but ...\"\nHis voice trailed away hopefully. They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together. Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. \"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\"",
        "and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. \"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"I'd light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something. ...\"\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. \"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\"",
        "\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood - I've found you a Seeker.\" Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \"Are you serious, Professor?\" \"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" Harry nodded silently.",
        "He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.\" Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. \"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.",
        "\"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained. \"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light - speedy - we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.\" \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. ...\"\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"",
        "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again - the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\" He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.",
        "\"All right, Harry?\" Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away from Krum. \"Know what you're going to do?\" \"Yeah,\" Harry panted, massaging his ribs. Bagman gave Harry's shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges' table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said, \"Sonorus!\" and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands. \"Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then. One ... two ... three!\"",
        "Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands. Harry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes. A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson. Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour's sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep.",
        "Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths. Harry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas - locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever. He looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed and shook his head.",
        "\"We do not help,\" he said in a harsh, croaky voice. \"Come ON!\" Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing. Harry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp ... anything ... There were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart.",
        "Ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water. Harry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were they playing at? Why didn't they hurry up?",
        "\"Right before you go into the lake, sir - gillyweed!\" \"What's it do?\" said Harry, staring at the gillyweed. \"It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!\" \"Dobby,\" said Harry frantically, \"listen - are you sure about this?\" He couldn't quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to \"help\" him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm. \"Dobby is quite sure, sir!\" said the elf earnestly. \"Dobby hears things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task. ... Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!\" Harry's doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels. \"Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!\" Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.",
        "Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\" There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible.",
        "Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him. To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could. Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest.",
        "Her potion already resembled the \"smooth, black currant-colored liquid\" mentioned as the ideal halfway stage. Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:\nCrush with flat side of silver dagger,\nreleases juice better than cutting. \"Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?\" Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.",
        "\"Yes,\" said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, \"I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age. ...\"\nAnd he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.",
        "The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione. \"Can I borrow your silver knife?\" She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now. Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger.",
        "To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook. His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According to the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice? Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest pink. \"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. \"Add a clockwise stir -\"\n\"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped. Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ...\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon. \"And time's ...",
        "up!\" called Slughorn. \"Stop stirring, please!\" Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff.",
        "At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron's cauldron. He passed over Ernie's navy concoction. Hermione's potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry's, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face. \"The clear winner!\" he cried to the dungeon. \"Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\"",
        "The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion -\"\n\"Encase? But how - ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \"Do I look as though I have tried it - do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to offend ...\"\n\"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly. \"It's natural to feel some curiosity about these things. ... Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. ...\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though - just out of curiosity - I mean, would one Horcrux be much use?",
        "Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven - ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case ... bad enough to divide the soul ... but to rip it into seven pieces ...\"\nSlughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.",
        "\"W-what's that?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"You-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?\" \"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen. ...\"\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages. \"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered. \"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle.",
        "Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\"",
        "\"What else could I do with it?\" Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore's will.\n\" 'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.' \"\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places.",
        "She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read.\n\" 'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight -' \"\n\"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. \"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!\" said Ron. \"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\" said Harry before he could stop himself.",
        "Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. \"Go on, Hermione.\" \" 'In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.\n\" 'And Death spoke to them -' \"\n\"Sorry,\" interjected Harry, \"but Death spoke to them?\" \"It's a fairy tale, Harry!\" \"Right, sorry.",
        "Go on.\" \" 'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.\n\" 'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother.\n\"",
        "'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.\n\" 'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.' \"\n\"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again.",
        "\"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking ... sorry, Hermione.\" \" 'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death's gifts.\n\" 'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.\n\" 'The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.\n\" 'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother's throat.\n\" 'And so Death took the first brother for his own.\n\" 'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.\n\" 'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her.\n\" 'And so Death took the second brother for his own.\n\" 'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.' \"\nHermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, \"Well, there you are.\" \"Sorry?\" said Hermione, sounding confused. \"Those are the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius. He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books.",
        "\"The Elder Wand,\" he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \"The Resurrection Stone,\" he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. \"The Cloak of Invisibility,\" he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. \"Together,\" he said, \"the Deathly Hallows.\" \"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story,\" said Hermione. \"Well, of course not,\" said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \"That is a children's tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.\" There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky.",
        "\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\" \"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. At last she found what she was looking for. \"I knew it! I knew it!\" \"Are we allowed to speak yet?\"",
        "said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!\" This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected. \"The what?\" said Harry and Ron. \"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look - read that, there.\"",
        "For a moment, Harry didn't recognize him ... then he realized it was Mr. Crouch. He looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving. Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man too had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley's hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants. \"Vosn't he a judge?\" said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. \"Isn't he vith your Ministry?\" Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.",
        "\"Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left him?\" \"He's dead,\" said Harry. \"Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\" The barman's face was impassive. After a few moments he said,\n\"I'm sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.\" He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. \"You're Aberforth,\" said Harry to the man's back. He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire. \"How did you get this?\" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before. \"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago,\" said Aberforth. \"Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\" Ron gasped. \"The silver doe!\" he said excitedly. \"Was that you too?\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Aberforth. \"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\" \"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son.",
        "He pulled out Hagrid's purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort. \"Kreacher, I'd, er, like you to have this,\" he said, pressing the locket into the elf's hand. \"This belonged to Regulus and I'm sure he'd want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you -\"\n\"Overkill, mate,\" said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione's direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.",
        "\"Expecto Patronum!\" A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn't worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain - concentrate -\nA pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor's robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry's ears. \"Expecto Patronum!\" His voice sounded dim and distant. ... Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand - he couldn't do it anymore, he couldn't work the spell -\nThere was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter. ... He could smell the dementor's putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, drowning him - Think ... something happy. ... But there was no happiness in him. ... The dementor's icy fingers were closing on his throat - the high-pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head - \"Bow to death, Harry.",
        "...\"\nHe was never going to see Ron and Hermione again -\nAnd their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath -\n\"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry's wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated. \"THIS WAY!\" Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. \"DUDLEY? DUDLEY!\" He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head toward Dudley's face as though about to kiss him. ...\n\"GET IT!\"",
        "It did not contain birthday greetings. Dear Mr. Potter,\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine. As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy. Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,\nMafalda Hopkirk\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\nMinistry of Magic\nHarry looked up from the letter and gulped. \"You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,\" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"Forgot to mention it. ... Slipped your mind, I daresay.",
        "\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think - let me think ...\"\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him. \"Yes ...\" said Ron softly, \"it's the only way ... I've got to be taken.\" \"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted. \"That's chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she'll take me - that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \"But -\"\n\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"",
        "The world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying -\nAnd then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school, and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. \"Get down!\" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry shouted, \"Percy, come on, we've got to move!\" he shook his head. \"Percy!\" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron's face as he seized his elder brother's shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. \"Percy, you can't do anything for him! We're going to -\"\nHermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why.",
        "A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall: One of Aragog's descendants had joined the fight. Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. \"It brought friends!\" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. \"Let's move, NOW!\" Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. \"Here,\" said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \"ROOKWOOD!\" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. \"Harry, in here!\" Hermione screamed. She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. \"Listen to me - LISTEN, RON!\" \"I wanna help - I wanna kill Death Eaters -\"\nHis face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief.",
        "\"Ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please - Ron - we need the snake, we've got to kill the snake!\" said Hermione. But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not - but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind -\n\"We will fight!\" Hermione said. \"We'll have to, to reach the snake! But let's not lose sight now of what we're supposed to be d-doing! We're the only ones who can end it!\"",
        "Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry's hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then -\nHe had gone. Harry's wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence.",
        "The basilisk!\" \"What the - ?\" \"Something to get rid of Horcruxes,\" said Ron simply. Harry's eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione's arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. \"But how did you get in there?\"",
        "he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. \"You need to speak Parseltongue!\" \"He did!\" whispered Hermione. \"Show him, Ron!\" Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise.",
        "\"It's what you did to open the locket,\" he told Harry apologetically. \"I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,\" he shrugged modestly, \"we got there in the end.\" \"He was amazing.\" said Hermione. \"Amazing!\" \"So ...\" Harry was struggling to keep up. \"So ...\"\n\"So we're another Horcrux down,\" said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff's cup. \"Hermione stabbed it.",
        "Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:\n\"Kill him.\" The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing -\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood - the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming -\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars -\nHe couldn't help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers -\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake's tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony. \"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD!",
        "said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world - hidden - buried or invisible -\"\n\"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack - the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\"",
        "As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face. \"Harry - oh, Harry - I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn't say it in front of Percy - it was me, Harry - but I - I s-swear I d-didn't mean to - R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over - and - how did you kill that - that thing? W-where's Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the diary -\"\n\"It's all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle's finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C'mon, Ginny, let's get out of here -\"\n\"I'm going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet.",
        "\"You can tell us what's going on.\" \"Is everyone okay?\" said Ginny and Tonks together.\n\" 'S far as we know,\" said Harry. \"Are there still people in the passage to the Hog's Head?\" He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it. \"I was the last to come through,\" said Mrs. Longbottom. \"I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?\"",
        "\"He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds -\"\nWithout another word, Tonks sped off. \"Ginny,\" said Harry, \"I'm sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.\" Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. \"And then you can come back in!\" he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks.",
        "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder - but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air - she and the others existed only in the mirror.",
        "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes - her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green - exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom?\"",
        "he whispered. \"Dad?\" They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees - Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed.",
        "The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.",
        "It's the nearest we'll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll like.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor. \"So ...\" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry - well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.\" \"How does it work?\" said Harry nervously. \"Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin, \"which is a kind of anti-dementor - a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\" Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon - hope, happiness, the desire to survive - but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\" \"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously.",
        "...\n\"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black ... Peter Pettigrew ... and, of course, your father, Harry - James Potter. \"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her. ... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. ...\n\"And they didn't desert me at all.",
        "Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door. \"Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it's us going down to Hagrid's!\" \"Are you telling me,\" Harry whispered, \"that we're here in this cupboard and we're out there too?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. \"I'm sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people ... and we're walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -\"\nShe broke off, still listening intently. \"We've gone down the front steps. ...\"\nHermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few questions answered. \"Where did you get that hourglass thing?\" \"It's called a Time-Turner,\" Hermione whispered, \"and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my studies.",
        "\"Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!\" \"But - how will that help Sirius?\" \"Dumbledore said - he just told us where the window is - the window of Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak - they can escape together!\" From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified. \"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!\" \"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?\" said Harry. He stood up and pressed his ear against the door. \"Doesn't sound like anyone's there. ... Come on, let's go.",
        "\"I don't know - Harry, look at Snape!\" Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle. \"Right, it's nearly time,\" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. \"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we're missing. ...\"\nThey waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again. \"D' you reckon he's up there yet?\" said Harry, checking his watch.",
        "\"But your friend - Nicolas Flamel -\"\n\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\" \"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\" \"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\" Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face. \"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing.",
        "Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch. He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and deposited them in the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip. A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin. But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before. \"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. ... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies ... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not ... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives. ... The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.",
        "He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione. \"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.\" Hagrid dropped the teapot. \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \"Fluffy?\"",
        "\"Yeah - he's mine - bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the -\"\n\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Now, don't ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That's top secret, that is.\" \"But Snape's trying to steal it.\"",
        "Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself -\n\"Sectum - !\" Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape's face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi -\n\"No, Potter!\" screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore. \"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them - I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so ...",
        "Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\" - Riddle's eyes glinted - \"how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her. ...\"\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them. \"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back.",
        "A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort's was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco's wand:\n\"Avada Kedavra!\" \"Expelliarmus!\" The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.",
        "As Harry shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" Voldemort cried, \"Avada Kedavra!\" A jet of green light issued from Voldemort's wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry's - they met in midair - and suddenly Harry's wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to - and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating. And then - nothing could have prepared Harry for this - he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. ... The Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands -\nThe golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. ...\n\"Do nothing!\" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \"Do nothing unless I command you!\" Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters. And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. ... It was coming from every thread of the light-spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort.",
        "A great silver cross ...\nHis heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red ... It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. ... The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.",
        "Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry?",
        "It's the nearest we'll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll like.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor. \"So ...\" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry - well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.\" \"How does it work?\" said Harry nervously. \"Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin, \"which is a kind of anti-dementor - a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\" Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon - hope, happiness, the desire to survive - but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\" \"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously.",
        "A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate. \"Here,\" Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward Harry's Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing. \"Read quickly and memorize.\" Harry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar. It said:\nThe headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.",
        "\"He's dead? His godfather?\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. \"Our problem,\" he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, \"is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\" \"He's been left a house?\" said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him. \"You can keep using it as headquarters,\" said Harry. \"I don't care. You can have it, I don't really want it.\" Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave. \"That is generous,\" said Dumbledore.",
        "You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.\" \"Do I - do I have to keep him with me?\" Harry asked, aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet. \"Not if you don't want to,\" said Dumbledore. \"If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry in relief, \"yeah, I'll do that. Er - Kreacher - I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves.\" Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished. \"Good,\" said Dumbledore. \"There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements -\"\n\"No,\" said Harry at once, \"he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.\"",
        "\"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about -\"\n\"Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\" \"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right?",
        "They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. \"Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,\" Ron said. \"That's why we haven't seen Umbridge, she'd never walk, she'd think she's too important.\" \"And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?\" Hermione asked.",
        "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. Professor M. McGonagall\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched one.\"",
        "roared Sir Cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them. Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Though Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, Harry had seen her in the common room only once before, and that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them, sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her face behind it. \"So that's it, is it?\" said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. \"Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.\" Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down. \"May I?\" said Professor McGonagall, but she didn't wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. \"Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?\"",
        "\"No,\" said Harry blankly. \"I see ... ,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Well, I'm afraid I will have to take this, Potter.\" \"W - what?\" said Harry, scrambling to his feet. \"Why?\" \"It will need to be checked for jinxes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Of course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down -\"\n\"Strip it down?\" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.",
        "\"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.\" \"There's nothing wrong with it!\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. \"Honestly, Professor -\"\n\"You can't know that, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed.\"",
        "Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. \"What did you go running to McGonagall for?\" Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly. \"Because I thought - and Professor McGonagall agrees with me - that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!\"",
        "To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook. His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According to the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice? Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest pink. \"How are you doing that?\" demanded Hermione, who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple. \"Add a clockwise stir -\"\n\"No, no, the book says counterclockwise!\" she snapped. Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ...\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else's potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon. \"And time's ...",

        "...\"\nThe slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished. The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had fallen silent. \"Professor Dumbledore?\"",
        "Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. \"It ... did that mean ... What did that mean?\" \"It meant,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.\" Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing seemed difficult again. \"It means - me?\" Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses. \"The odd thing is, Harry,\" he said softly, \"that it may not have meant you at all.",
        "Sibyll's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.\" \"But then ... but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville's?\" \"The official record was relabeled after Voldemort's attack on you as a child,\" said Dumbledore.",
        "\"It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.\" \"Then - it might not be me?\" said Harry. \"I am afraid,\" said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, \"that there is no doubt that it is you.\" \"But you said - Neville was born at the end of July too - and his mum and dad -\"\n\"You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. ... Voldemort himself would 'mark him as his equal.' And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.\" \"But he might have chosen wrong!\"",
        "said Harry. \"He might have marked the wrong person!\" \"He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,\" said Dumbledore. \"And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far - something that neither your parents, nor Neville's parents, ever achieved.\" \"Why did he do it, then?\" said Harry, who felt numb and cold. \"Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then -\"\n\"That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,\" said Dumbledore, \"except that Voldemort's information about the prophecy was incomplete.",
        "...\nWormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt Wormtail's anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him. \"B-blood of the enemy ... forcibly taken ... you will ... resurrect your foe.\" Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. ... Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail's remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry's cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.",
        "He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry's blood. He poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing. The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness.",
        "Nothing happened. ...\nLet it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. ...\nAnd then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn't see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air. ... It's gone wrong, he thought ... it's drowned ... please ... please let it be dead. ... But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron. \"Robe me,\" said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master's head. The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry ... and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake's with slits for nostrils ...\nLord Voldemort had risen again.",
        "Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. \"After all this time?\" \"Always,\" said Snape. And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. \"You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure from his aunt and uncle's,\" said Dumbledore. \"Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry's safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly.",
        "Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock. \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you. ...\"\nSnape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph.",
        "\"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did ... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.\"",
        "\"Voldemort's grandfather, yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\" \"So Merope,\" said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, \"so Merope was ... Sir, does that mean she was ... Voldemort's mother?\" \"It does,\" said Dumbledore. \"And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort's father. I wonder whether you noticed?\" \"The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\" \"Very good indeed,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\" \"And they ended up married?\" Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love. \"I think you are forgetting,\" said Dumbledore, \"that Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years. \"Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\" \"The Imperius Curse?\"",
        "he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\" Harry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others. ... At last he forced himself to speak. \"You're not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred. \"Not what?\" snapped Riddle.",
        "Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. \"Hippogriffs!\" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \"Beau'iful, aren' they?\" Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. \"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer -\"\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously. \"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,\" said Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. \"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,\" Hagrid continued. \"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow, then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt. \"Right - who wants ter go first?\" Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being tethered like this. \"No one?\"",
        "said Hagrid, with a pleading look. \"I'll do it,\" said Harry. There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \"Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\" Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence. \"Good man, Harry!\" roared Hagrid.",
        "\"Right then - let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.\" He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously. \"Easy, now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink. ... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much.",
        "Harry's lips were cold and numb. \"So ... when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ...\"\n\"The Malfoys - undoubtedly on Voldemort's instructions - had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.\" There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs, his breathing was quick and shallow. \"And Kreacher told you all this ... and laughed?\" he croaked. \"He did not wish to tell me,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.\" \"And,\" whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, \"and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him -\"\n\"She was quite right, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.",
        "\"I think, Minister,\" said Umbridge silkily from beside him, \"we might make better progress if I fetch our informant.\" \"Yes, yes, do,\" said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. \"There's nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore?\" \"Nothing at all, Cornelius,\" said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head. There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho's curly-haired friend Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands. \"Don't be scared, dear, don't be frightened,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, \"it's quite all right, now. You have done the right thing.",
        "The minister is very pleased with you. He'll be telling your mother what a good girl you've been. Marietta's mother, Minister,\" she added, looking up at Fudge, \"is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network office - she's been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.\" \"Jolly good, jolly good!\" said Fudge heartily. \"Like mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don't be shy, let's hear what you've got to - galloping gargoyles!\"",
        "As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before the whole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word \"SNEAK.\" \"Never mind the spots now, dear,\" said Umbridge impatiently, \"just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister -\"\nBut Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically. \"Oh, very well, you silly girl, I'll tell him,\" snapped Umbridge. She hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, \"Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately at that point this hex,\" she waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face, \"came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.\" \"Well, now,\" said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look. \"It is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What was its purpose? Who was there?\" But Marietta would not speak. She merely shook her head again, her eyes wide and fearful.",
        "Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. \"I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.\" And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes. \"My Lord - let me go to the boy -\"\n\"All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,\" said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, \"wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner ... and I think I have the answer.\" Snape did not speak. \"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.\"",
        "\"My Lord -\"\n\"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.\" \"My Lord!\" Snape protested, raising his wand. \"It cannot be any other way,\" said Voldemort. \"I must master the wand, Severus.",
        "Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\" And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But then Voldemort's intention became clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. \"Kill.\" There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. \"I regret it,\" said Voldemort coldly. He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse.",
        "It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. \"Harry!\" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.",
        "He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: He did not know what he felt as he saw Snape's white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close. A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. \"Take ... it. ... Take ... it. ...\"\nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do -\nA flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened. \"Look ... at ... me. ...\" he whispered. The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more.",
        "How many men and women have you watched die?\" \"Lately, only those whom I could not save,\" said Snape. He stood up. \"You have used me.\" \"Meaning?\" \"I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you.",
        "...\n\"Hermione, think of something happy!\" Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it -\nI'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys. He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: \"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!\" Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death.",
        "He's torturing him. ... Says he'll end by killing him ...\"\nHarry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself. \"How're we going to get there?\" he asked them. There was a moment's silence. Then Ron said, \"G-get there?\" \"Get to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!\"",
        "\"But I've got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. 'I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.' \"\n\"You've got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\" And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. \"Aren't you Lucius Malfoy's son?\"",
        "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it - it sounded a bit like an owl. A second, very small parcel contained a note. We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.",
        "He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy - he didn't feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. \"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us - if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own -\"\n\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom. \"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces.",
        "All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them. \"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered. \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\" \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes ...\"\nHe put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased - it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.",
        "Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore's sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him. \"Professor,\" Harry gasped, \"I know I shouldn't've - I didn't mean - the cabinet door was sort of open and -\"\n\"I quite understand,\" said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him. Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silvery-white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze. \"What is it?\" Harry asked shakily. \"This? It is called a Pensieve,\" said Dumbledore.",
        "Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it. Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he'd just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk's mouth. Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring.",
        "\"Yes,\" said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, \"because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.\" \"What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?\" asked Harry. \"Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,\" said Ron. \"I was wondering what we were going to do with them.\" \"It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,\" said Hermione patiently. \"It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare -\n\"- phoenix tears,\" said Harry, nodding. \"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they're all dangerous to carry around with you. That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair.\" \"But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\" said Ron, \"why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?\" \"Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\"",
        "Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. ... A serpent's head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up. \"Naturally, naturally,\" murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. \"But in essence divided?\" Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze, and vanished. Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table; Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again.",
        "He's been in my family for ages, right -\"\n\"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long?\" \"We - we've been taking good care of him!\" said Ron. \"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I'd guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. ...\"\n\"He's been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed. But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly. ... Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks ... ever since Ron's return from Egypt ... since the time when Black had escaped. ...\n\"This cat isn't mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head.",
        "\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. \"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room.\" Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\" He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life.",
        "\"I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces. ...\"\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess -\"\n\"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" \"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\" \"What about you?\" \"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron.",
        "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. \"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes ... look ...\"\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost? \"Harry - move diagonally four squares to the right.\"",
        "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed - for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.",
        "\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\" The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git''\n\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.\"",
        "\"Merry Christmas!\" \"Hey, look - Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\" Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\" \"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.\"",
        "And you never realized it, because of the thing you can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?\" Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart. \"Snape's Patronus was a doe,\" said Harry, \"the same as my mother's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,\" he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, \"he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?\"",
        "Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. \"After all this time?\" \"Always,\" said Snape. And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk. \"You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry's departure from his aunt and uncle's,\" said Dumbledore. \"Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry's safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly.",
        "He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \"I'm freezing,\" said Ron.",
        "\"This solid silver, mate?\" \"Yes,\" said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. \"Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.\" \"That'd come off, though,\" muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff. \"Fred - George - NO, JUST CARRY THEM!\" Mrs. Weasley shrieked. Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.",
        "\"Tut, tut - fame clearly isn't everything.\" He ignored Hermione's hand. \"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\" Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.",
        "Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But no - she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn't do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else. He found it hard to concentrate on Snape's Potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient - a bezoar - meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn't care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door. \"I'll meet you at dinner,\" he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs. He'd just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all.",
        "\"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\" Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say 'Up!' \"\n\"UP!\" everyone shouted.",
        "\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\" \"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this. ...\"\nHe made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.",
        "\"So how about it?\" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. \"Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!\" Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot. \"Okay,\" he said. \"But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.\" On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors.\n\" 'Bye!\" Harry called to Ron. \"See you when you get back!\" Ron grinned and winked.",
        "\"Dobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!\" \"Why?\" said Harry curiously. \"Because it is a room that a person can only enter,\" said Dobby seriously, \"when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs.",
        "- knows nothin' abou' - about ANYTHING?\" Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad. \"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\"",
        "\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\" She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \"Er - all right.\"",
        "I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.\" Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.",
        "Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing noise. Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers. \"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared. \"What's my rat got to do with anything?\" \"That's not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly. \"What d'you mean - of course he's a rat -\"\n\"No, he's not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He's a wizard.\" \"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"",
        "\"Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,\" said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, \"occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continuously upon your destination, and move, without haste, but with deliberation ... thus.\" Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall. \"Remember the three D's,\" he said, \"and try again ... one - two - three -\"\nBut an hour later, Susan's Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged.",
        "\"Destination, Determination, Deliberation! \"Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,\" said Twycross. \"In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.\" Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts. \"Step two,\" said Twycross, \"focus your determination to occupy the visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!\" Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop."

            "\"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast. \"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -\"\nThe smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look. \"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\" he hissed. \"He's not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted.",
            "There's a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now. ...\"\nDobby threw his arms around Harry's middle and hugged him. \"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed. \"Farewell, Harry Potter!\" And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn't know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron's four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. \"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He was starting to grow on me.\" The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.",
            "If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left - Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows - but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry's suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them. \"I'll see you two later,\" said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself. \"But what're you - ?\" asked Neville. \"Later!\" whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless. The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions.",
            "Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric's Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald's next movements is that he \"traveled abroad for some months.\" It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric's Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. \"He seemed a charming boy to me,\" babbles Bathilda, \"whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.\" They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. \"Yes, even after they'd spent all day in discussion - both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire - I'd sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert's bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!\" And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore's fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.)",
            "\"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape - wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\" \"Why me?\" \"Its obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\""

            "\"George, be quiet!\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"Anyway,\" said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, \"this time Willy's been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don't think he'll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo's for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it, Muggles in St. Mungo's! I wonder which ward they're in?\"",
            "\"Why don't we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it's a bit cold, isn't it? You don't have to talk to Ron!\" she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence. The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves. It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions.",
            "\"Ten points from Gryffindor.\" Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them. \"Before we start, I want your dementor essays,\" said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. \"And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page - what is it, Mr. Finnigan?\" \"Sir,\" said Seamus, \"I've been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius -\"\n\"No, there wasn't,\" said Snape in a bored voice. \"But sir, I heard people talking -\"\n\"If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.\"",
            "As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations. \"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\" said Hermione.",
            "And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.\" Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team. Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks. Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, \"So - have you heard from Sirius lately?\" Hermione looked around, listening closely. \"Yeah,\" said Harry softly, \"twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I'm here.\" He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn't want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful."

He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now. \"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second crumpet, \"is to decide where you're going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation.

I got this one,\" he indicated another slash to his face, \"for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.\" \"Blimey, Neville,\" said Ron, \"there's a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.\" \"You didn't hear her,\" said Neville. \"You wouldn't have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.\" \"But they've used you as a knife sharpener,\" said Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville's injuries were thrown into even greater relief. Neville shrugged. \"Doesn't matter. They don't want to spill too much pure blood, so they'll torture us a bit if we're mouthy but they won't actually kill us.\" Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them. \"The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble.",

            "All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.\" \"At Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry repeated, stunned.",

Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid's old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn't supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why - any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. \"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you've done a good job on them.\" \"That's what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron."

Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment. \"We can't, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking apologetic. \"Ron and I've got to go to the prefects' carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.\" \"Oh yeah, I forgot,\" said Harry. \"You'd better get straight on the train, all of you, you've only got a few minutes to go,\" said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. \"Well, have a lovely term, Ron. ...\"\n\"Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?\" said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment. \"Of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless. Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger. He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away. \"When we were in Diagon Alley,\" Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace. \"Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George's shop?\" \"How did you - ?\" \"Harry, please.

Harry could not suppress a grin. Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly. \"That's it,\" he said in his quavery old voice, \"no need to be nervous. ...

Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass.

For several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped hurting now. He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore's office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry's House."

Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely. Think, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think ... But not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky.

There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \"Harry!\" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two.",
            "All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods. \"Ah, Probity Probes,\" sighed Travers theatrically, \"so crude - but effective!\" And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds; Harry pointed Draco's wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, \"Confundo\" twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them. Hermione's long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. \"One moment, madam,\" said the guard, raising his Probe. \"But you've just done that!\" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,\n\"Yeah, you've just checked them, Marius.\" Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them.",
            "\"Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\" Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. \"Look at page two.\" Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art.\n\" 'Muggle-born Register,' \" she read aloud. \" 'The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called \"Muggle-borns,\" the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets.\n\"",
            "said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. \"He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can!\" They stared at each other. \"Blimey,\" whispered Ron. \"You don't reckon ... he hasn't found ... ?\" \"Better go and see, hadn't I?\" said Harry, jumping to his feet. He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry's defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms. And then Harry heard a scream and a crash."

            "Ron hissed in Harry's ear. Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry. \"As to our second new appointment,\" Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. \"Well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned.",
            "...\"\n\"I warned her!\" said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling her hands. \"I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one ...\" He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: \" 'I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.' Blimey, she'd better watch out for herself.\" Hermione didn't turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls.",
            "And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.\" Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team. Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks. Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, \"So - have you heard from Sirius lately?\" Hermione looked around, listening closely. \"Yeah,\" said Harry softly, \"twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I'm here.\" He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him ... but he really didn't want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.",
            "Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\" and scanned it carefully. As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. ... There were a few people out in the grounds ... and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not.",
            "Underneath the photograph was the caption: EILEEN PRINCE, CAPTAIN OF THE HOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM. \"So?\" said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions. \"Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.\" They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing. \"No way.\" \"What?\" \"You think she was the Half-Blood ... ? Oh, come on.\" \"Well, why not? Harry, there aren't any real princes in the Wizarding world! It's either a nickname, a made-up title somebody's given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn't it? No, listen!"

            "Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don't leave me!\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents? Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth.",
            "With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. \"What was that?\" \"Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\" Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry's heart, however, was still pounding.",
            "Hermione squealed. \"I nearly forgot! Stand back -\"\nShe pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as though it was still closed. \"And now,\" she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, \"we put on the Cloak again -\"\n\"- and we wait,\" Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione's head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry. Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione's silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.",
            "\"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues -\"\nProfessor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic.",
            "Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay! \"Right,\" said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. \"I'll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\" Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes."

            "A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron's ankle. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron's leg and retied it shut. \"What are you doing with all those books anyway?\" Ron asked, limping back to his bed. \"Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,\" said Hermione. \"When we're looking for the Horcruxes.\" \"Oh, of course,\" said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. \"I forgot we'll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.\" \"Ha ha,\" said Hermione, looking down at Spellman's Syllabary. \"I wonder ... will we need to translate runes? It's possible. ... I think we'd better take it, to be safe.\" She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. \"Listen,\" said Harry. He had sat up straight.",
            "For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation. Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn't understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn't see anyone. \"Who's there?\" he called again. \"Harry, come on, move!\" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward. \"What's the matter?\" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified. \"It's the Dark Mark, Harry!\" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.",
            "\"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.\" So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry's mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. \"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.",
            "The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canaps, however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander. \"I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she'll be able to delay you leaving,\" Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay. \"And then what does she think's going to happen?\" Harry muttered. \"Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she's holding us here making vol-au-vents?\" He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny's face whiten. \"So it's true?\" she said. \"That's what you're trying to do?\" \"I - not - I was joking,\" said Harry evasively. They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny's expression.",
            "She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon. \"Ha!\" said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts. \"Oh good,\" said Hermione, delighted. \"Now you can give that graffitied copy back.\" \"Are you mad?\" said Harry. \"I'm keeping it! Look, I've thought it out -\"\nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, \"Diffindo!\""

Wear your dragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.\" Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints. \"This'll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,\" said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. \"An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus.

            "\"Dumbledore's reading what signs?\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"Harry - what's up?\" For Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap. \"I shouldn't've told him!\" Harry said furiously. \"What are you on about?\" said Ron in surprise. \"It's made him think he's got to come back!\" said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron's chair, hooting indignantly. \"Coming back, because he thinks I'm in trouble! And there's nothing wrong with me! And I haven't got anything for you,\" Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, \"you'll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.\" Hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.",

Augustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick, and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something - perhaps Azkaban - had taken most of her beauty.",
            "...\"\nAnd Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying - actually crying - tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy's hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another -\n\"No!

Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.\" \"O' - o' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \"Come in, come in. ...\"\nHarry and Hermione listened closely.

He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore. \"There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric's death,\" Dumbledore went on. \"I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.\" A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry's direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore. \"Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,\" said Dumbledore. \"He risked his own life to return Cedric's body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor him.\" Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric's, and drank to him.

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. ... Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.",

This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.",

Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the time of the -\"\n\"We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!\" snarled Fudge. \"Of course you are,\" said Dumbledore courteously. \"Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?\" \"If there were dementors, which I doubt -\"\n\"You have heard from an eyewitness,\" Dumbledore interrupted.",

No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.\" Just then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald-green skull. \"The Dark Mark!\" he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues.",

Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above. \"Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don't we? They shouldn't be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.\" Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order's charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble."

'I would rather die than betray his trust.' \"\n\"That's not saying much, seeing as you're already dead,\" Ron observed. \"Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\" said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly. \"The very best of evenings to you!\"",
            "He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. ... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter - the boy who lived!\"",
            "\"My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!\" said Professor Trelawney \"If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever -\"\n\"I don't want to see anything except a headache cure,\" said Harry. He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved. \"See you later,\" Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.",
            "A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at waist height. \"Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,\" said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. \"It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. ... Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.\" Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped toward the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind. ...\nHow long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, and Ginny's luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the D.A.? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds. ... Would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend? As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed."

Some people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.",
            "Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily. \"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\" Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky.",
            "\"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. ... He mentioned his son.\" \"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily.",
            "Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn. \"Look sharp, Tom,\" said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. \"You don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...\"\n\"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. ...\"\n\"Sir, I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?\" And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn's voice boomed out again, just as it had done before. \"I don't know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn't tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don't let me catch you mentioning them again!\" \"Well, that's that,\" said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry.",
            "At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry's situation worse: Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid. \"It's Peeves, Professor,\" Filch whispered malevolently. \"He threw this egg down the stairs.\" Snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch."

He thinks he's identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference -\"\nThere was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same.",
            "Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, \"Look, I didn't make up the name 'Slug Club' -\"\n\" 'Slug Club,' \" repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. \"It's pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don't you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug -\"\n\"We're allowed to bring guests,\" said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, \"and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it's that stupid then I won't bother!\" Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them.",
            "He didn't like that,\" said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother .. . Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place? \"And there was an argument .. and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend - and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it -\"\nThe color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. \"- and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't know which of us did it, it could have been any of us - and she was dead.\" His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it.",
            "He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos!\" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway.",
            "He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before."

Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott's Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince's hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, \"Specialis Revelio!\" over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him. It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him.

He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library. Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor's chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski.",

After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters. \"That's my final decision and if you don't get out of the way for the Keepers I'll hex you,\" he bellowed. Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member. Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever.

It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is.

Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary. \"There you go,\" said Fred proudly.",
            "\"Was dat man - was Sirius Black a - a friend of yours?\" Harry nodded. \"Here,\" said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville's legs he said, \"Finite.\" The spell was lifted. Neville's legs fell back onto the floor and remained still. Lupin's face was pale. \"Let's - let's find the others. Where are they all, Neville?\" Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke.",
            "\"What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?\" \"Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,\" croaked Kreacher. \"Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then ... it was a little while later ... Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell ... and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. ...\"\nAnd so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius. ... Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison. ...\n\"And he made you drink the potion?\"",
            "\"Thanks, Dobby!\" said Harry, stroking Hedwig's head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream. ... It had been very vivid. ... Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his feet looked far too big for his body."

            "Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron's tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts. At five o'clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge's office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it. \"You know what to do, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge, smiling sweetly over at him. Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right ... On the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.",
            "Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. \"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off. ...\"\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself. \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. ... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand - the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors.",
            "As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years' free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione's increasing resentment, Harry's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince. Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud.",
            "said Hermione. Harry and Ron goggled at her. \"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. \"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \"It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there.",
            "\"Hang on,\" said Ron, frowning. \"The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn't it? How does that work, then?\" \"While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don't mean holding it for too long, it's nothing to do with touching it,\" she added before Ron could speak. \"I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You're in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.\" \"I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\" said Harry. \"Why didn't I ask him? I never really ...\"\nHis voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... to find out everything. ..."

Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore's right, did not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much. \"Well, there's one good thing,\" he said savagely. \"Snape'll be gone by the end of the year.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Ron. \"That job's jinxed.

Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the tea shop, he saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands.",
            "Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he'd finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake. Alarmed as she was by Sirius's warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem. \"Let's just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,\" she said desperately, \"and then we can worry about Karkaroff.\" They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.\n\" 'Talon-clipping by charms ... treating scale-rot ...' This is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. ...\"\n\" 'Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate ...' But Sirius said a simple one would do it. ...\"\n\"Let's try some simple spellbooks, then,\" said Harry, throwing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much. He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow. \"Well, there are Switching Spells ... but what's the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. ... The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon's hide.",
            "Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who's inner circle.\" Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they didn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. \"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. ...\" said Harry. \"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they'll be rich,\" said Fred. \"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" said George. \"But all we've got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn't catch one in our house. ...\"\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?",
            "The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears. Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people."

            "\"We thought -\"\nHermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed. \"- we thought it'd be something like that.\" \"You did?\" said Harry, amused. \"Yeah ... yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don't we? So, er, what's he like?\"",
            "...\"\nBut Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge's corridor. \"Got it,\" he panted. \"Ready to go, then?\" \"All right,\" whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years passed them. \"So Ron - you go and head Umbridge off. ...

The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges' vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed Griphook. The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work.",

He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness. ...\"\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage. \"So you never - never attacked anyone?\" \"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human.",

The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" \"What?\" said Hermione. \"No, no, that's mine -\"\n\"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. \"But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \"Imperio!\" once more. \"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't you?\" Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached. \"I shall need the Clankers,\" he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. \"Good, good!",

To the class's horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely. \"Take this thing for a walk?\" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes. \"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash?",

Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other - but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years. A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. Harry's eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet. \"Hang on ...\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There's an empty chair at the staff table. ... Where's Snape?\" Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape's least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own House (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. \"Maybe he's ill!\" said Ron hopefully. \"Maybe he's left,\" said Harry, \"because he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again!\" \"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically.",

Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic. Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned. \"Harry! HARRY!\" They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor - Ron looking incredibly freckly Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him. \"Finally!\" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \"We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and -\"\n\"I got all my school stuff last week,\" Harry explained. \"And how come you knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?\" \"Dad,\" said Ron simply.",

The above is in accordance with\nEducational Decree Number Twenty-six. Signed:\nDolores Jane Umbridge\nHIGH INQUISITOR\nThis latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class. \"Exploding Snap's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That's not information relating to your subject!\" When Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap. Harry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved Fudge's nose."

Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves.",

            "At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry - he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. \"Ah, yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new - celebrity.\" Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.",
            "Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry.",
            "She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. \"Harry ...\"\n\"Where's my wand?\" She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think properly: Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the wand to Hermione. \"Mend it. Please.\" \"Harry, I don't think, when it's broken like this -\"\n\"Please, Hermione, try!\" \"R-Reparo.\" The dangling half of the wand resealed itself."

Snape backtracked at once. \"I didn't mean - I just don't want to see you made a fool of - He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!\" The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. \"And he's not ... everyone thinks ... big Quidditch hero -\" Snape's bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily's eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. \"I know James Potter's an arrogant toerag,\" she said, cutting across Snape. \"I don't need you to tell me that.

Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall's desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink. \"What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban - we need our gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" he added thoughtfully. \"We'll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.",
            "\"Hi, Harry,\" said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite Harry. Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that, given her way, she would not be here at all. In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry. \"Er,\" said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. \"Well - er - hi.\" The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry. \"Well ... erm ... well, you know why you're here. Erm ... well, Harry here had the idea - I mean\" - Harry had thrown her a sharp look - \"I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us\" - (Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) - \"because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts\" - \"Hear, hear,\" said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened - \"well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.\" She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, \"And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells -\"\n\"You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though, I bet?\"",

Minerva, I'm surprised at you - I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch -\"\n\"There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumbledore!\" she shrieked. \"The Minister has seen to that!\" Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury. \"When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight's events,\" said Snape, in a low voice, \"he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle.",
            "For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:\nA thousand years or more ago,\nWhen I was newly sewn,\nThere lived four wizards of renown,\nWhose names are still well known:\nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor,\nFair Ravenclaw, from glen,\nSweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,\nShrewd Slytherin, from fen. They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,\nThey hatched a daring plan\nTo educate young sorcerers\nThus Hogwarts School began. Now each of these four founders\nFormed their own house, for each\nDid value different virtues\nIn the ones they had to teach. By Gryffindor, the bravest were\nPrized far beyond the rest;\nFor Ravenclaw, the cleverest\nWould always be the best;\nFor Hufflepuff, hard workers were\nMost worthy of admission;\nAnd power-hungry Slytherin\nLoved those of great ambition. While still alive they did divide\nTheir favorites from the throng,\nYet how to pick the worthy ones\nWhen they were dead and gone? 'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,\nHe whipped me off his head\nThe founders put some brains in me\nSo I could choose instead! Now slip me snug about your ears,\nI've never yet been wrong,\nI'll have a look inside your mind\nAnd tell where you belong!

She looked flabbergasted. \"The Dark Lord,\" said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, \"had always been happy with the wand I made him - yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches - until he discovered the connection of the twin cores.

            "Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next. Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood. \"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.",
            "After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\" \"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl - a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl - a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\nGiven Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather's horrible. Hope you're well. Hagrid\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.",

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.",
            "\"OY!\" But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James's face, spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants. Many people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, and Wormtail roared with laughter. Lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, \"Let him down!\" \"Certainly,\" said James and he jerked his wand upward.",

You know why, I'm sure?\" Harry shrugged.

On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.",

He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, he reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it - eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself. \"Anyway, Grawpy,\" shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, \"I've brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?\" But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech.

The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck.

They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms. Harry's favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year.

Harry tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl's beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night. \"Enough - effing - owls ...\" muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.

Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.

He didn't like magic, my father ...\n\"He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage ... but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name ...

But look, Harry!",
            "Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting. Extra lessons with Snape - what on earth had he done to deserve this? He looked quickly around at Sirius for support. \"Why can't Dumbledore teach Harry?\" asked Sirius aggressively. \"Why you?\" \"I suppose because it is a headmaster's privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,\" said Snape silkily. \"I assure you I did not beg for the job.\" He got to his feet. \"I will expect you at six o'clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.\" He turned to leave, his black traveling cloak billowing behind him.",

Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!\" Hermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply. \"If I can just poke the sword through a handle - but how am I going to get up there?\" The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry's face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces. \"Hermione,\" said Harry as the clanking grew louder, \"I've got to get up there, we've got to get rid of it -\"\nShe raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, \"Levicorpus.\" Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate."

They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. \"Once we've left, the ghoul's going to come and live down here in my room,\" said Ron. \"I think he's really looking forward to it - well, it's hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool - but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he's going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?\" Harry merely looked his confusion. \"It is!\" said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan.",
            "The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could hear was Ron's breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, \"Couldn't you see what the thief was holding?\" \"No ... it must've been something small.\" \"Harry?\" The wooden slats of Ron's bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. \"Harry, you don't reckon You-Know-Who's after something else to turn into a Horcrux?\" \"I don't know,\" said Harry slowly.",
            "\"So what?\" He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said \"So what?\" upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother. \"I'll explain inside,\" said Ron quietly, \"c'mon. ...\"\nFleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor. \"So?\" Harry prompted Ron. \"What's the problem with giants?\"",
            "\"What's up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge. Ginny didn't say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn't think who. \"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her. Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information. \"I've got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry. \"What is it?\" said Harry. Ginny looked as though she couldn't find the right words. \"What?\" said Ron. Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him. \"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\" Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan. \"If you've finished eating, I'll take that seat, Ginny. I'm starving, I've only just come off patrol duty.\"",
            "... The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly. \"Shh, Fang, it's us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry. \"Yeah ...\"\nHarry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap. \"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly."

The moment it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. \"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \"Oh, you know what I mean - Goyle's potion looked like bogies.\" \"Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\" said Moody. Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia's gleaming sink. \"We're one short,\" said Lupin. \"Here,\" said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead. \"I've toldjer, I'd sooner be a protector,\" said Mundungus. \"Shut it,\" growled Moody. \"As I've already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It'll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters'll want to kill them.\" Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \"Altogether, then ...\"\nRon, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.

Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\" \"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \"I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\" \"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely - surely - they weren't about to be punished? \"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules,\" said Dumbledore. Ron opened his mouth in horror. \"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and - let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\" Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart's valentine flowers and closed his mouth again. \"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest, Gilderoy?\" Harry gave a start.",
            "\"Snape killed? What're yeh on abou', Harry?\" \"Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Snape killed ... Dumbledore.\" Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending. \"Dumbledore wha', Harry?\" \"He's dead. Snape killed him. ...\"\n\"Don' say that,\" said Hagrid roughly.",
            "...\"\nDumbledore cleared his throat and continued, \"As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business.\" He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school. \"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,\" Dumbledore continued, \"and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises - or even Invisibility Cloaks,\" he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,\" he said. Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound. \"On a happier note,\" he continued, \"I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. \"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\" There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes. \"Look at Snape!\"",
            "Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual. \"Pajama party, is it?\" he growled up the stairs. \"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,\" said Filch at once. \"Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual - and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off -\"\n\"Shut up!\" Snape hissed to Filch. Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody's magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself. Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again. \"Did I hear that correctly, Snape?\" he asked slowly. \"Someone broke into your office?\" \"It is unimportant,\" said Snape coldly. \"On the contrary,\" growled Moody, \"it is very important. Who'd want to break into your office?\" \"A student, I daresay,\" said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape's greasy temple. \"It has happened before."

Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley's car (which hadn't been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next. No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts. The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling.

Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one. \"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read. \"He murdered thirteen people?\" said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, \"with one curse?\" \"Yep,\" said Stan, \"in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\" \"Ar,\" said Ern darkly.

He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades. \"For the last time, just forget about Malfoy,\" Hermione told Harry firmly. They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet - Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them - for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves. Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner. \"It isn't Lavender,\" said Hermione wearily.",

When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as though he weighed every word. \"It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas -\"\n\"The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?\" \"Do not interrupt me, Potter,\" said Snape in a dangerous voice. \"As I was saying ... the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord's thoughts -\"\n\"I saw inside the snake's head, not his!\" \"I thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?\" But Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that, without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised for flight. \"How come I saw through the snake's eyes if it's Voldemort's thoughts I'm sharing?\"",

The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet. \"Expelliarmus!\" Lupin shouted. Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across his chest. Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry's mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.

He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why - any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. \"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you've done a good job on them.\" \"That's what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron.",

Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike."

He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\" \"We're not leaving,\" said Harry. \"We need to get into Hogwarts.\" \"Don't be stupid, boy,\" said Aberforth. \"We've got to,\" said Harry. \"What you've got to do,\" said Aberforth, leaning forward, \"is to get as far from here as you can.\" \"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore - I mean, your brother - wanted us -\"\nThe firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. \"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\" said Aberforth, \"and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans.",
            "Dennis's guess was closer. ... As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed - then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year's foot, the horses' hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes. Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened. A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage - a shoe the size of a child's sled - followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped. Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow - maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid - this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers. Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman. Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand.",
            "Hermione called commandingly along the table. \"This way, please!\" A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified, nudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like Stinksap.",

Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously around the corner. \"Keep your wand out,\" she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk. \"Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there's going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg.

Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer. \"As you might have noticed,\" said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, \"that memory has been tampered with.\"",

Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him that he should not listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but he had no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, whether he would have dared to even if he had the chance. Instead he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape. \"Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,\" said Hermione at once. \"Well, you won't be sorry not to have them anymore, will you?\" \"Extra lessons with Snape?\" said Ron, sounding aghast. \"I'd rather have the nightmares!\" They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived there next morning.

The tree they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach. \"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving -\n\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry's lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. \"We're done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted. \"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach. \"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close.

Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!\" \"Ill-informed sniping,\" said Doge, turning radish-colored again. \"You would say that, Elphias,\" cackled Auntie Muriel. \"I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\"",
            "bellowed Uncle Vernon, \"with his sprinklers on at three in the morning! \"); then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband (\"as if we're interested in their sordid affairs,\" sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on). Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, \"And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more. ...\"\nHarry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.",
            "GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle. \"They're all like it!\" said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another. \" 'Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you. ...' 'You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn.",
            "yelled Percy. \"I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed,\" Harry said to Ron, and he went downstairs. Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he'd heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door. \"... makes no sense not to tell him,\" Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \"Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He's thirteen years old and -\"\n\"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \"Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven's sake, he's happy not knowing!\" \"I don't want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\"",
            "... Where's Crookshanks?\" \"Ginny's got him,\" said Harry. \"There she is. ...\"\nGinny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks. \"Thanks,\" said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. \"Come on, let's get a carriage together before they all fill up. ...\"\n\"I haven't got Pig yet!\" Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind with Ron."
        ],
        [
            "\"Come on, this way.\" They crept off. Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder's Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist's approach.",
            "\"And Ron?\" \"I dink he's all right - he was still fighding the brain when I left -\"\nThe stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy -\"\nThe man was pressing so tightly on Harry's windpipe that he could not breathe - through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix - nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. ... He turned his wand backward toward the man's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man's free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy -\n\"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, \"STUPEFY!\" The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It was Macnair, Buckbeak's would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs. Then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped - for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody's magic eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee.",
            "said Harry. He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad joke, it had to be. \"I asked you,\" said Moody quietly, \"whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn't even brave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky.\" \"You fired ... What are you talking about ... ?\" \"I told you, Harry ... I told you. If there's one thing I hate more than any other, it's a Death Eater who walked free.",
            "\"Sorry!\" yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed. \"Hang on - I'll let you down -\"\nHe groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.",
            "You stay there,\" he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green. With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o'clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione's feelings. The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease. He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road. There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark: He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him relentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. ... Stupid idea, he told himself, don't think that. ...\nHis scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead."

Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. \"What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME!",
            "\"Well then, you're in,\" said Harry. \"There's a practice tonight, seven o'clock.\" \"Right,\" said Dean. \"Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can't wait to tell Ginny!\" He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus's head as one of Hermione's canaries whizzed over them. Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie's substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost ... well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. ...\nHarry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron. Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.",
            "\"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\" Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.",
            "He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes. \"Come on,\" said Ron's voice in his ear. \"Move - come on -\"\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn't have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, \"You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?\" \"I'm a what?\" said Harry. \"A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\" \"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to - that was before I knew I was a wizard -\"\n\"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeated faintly."

A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him. \"All right?\" \"Never been better,\" said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. \"You?\" \"Not bad,\" said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it.",
            "Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more. A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses. He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or - something else. \"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter -\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light -\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time.

The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?\" \"I know,\" said Harry, \"but McGonagall still wants to strip it down -\"\nWood went pale.",
            "A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at waist height. \"Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,\" said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. \"It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. ... Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.\" Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped toward the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind. ...\nHow long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, and Ginny's luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the D.A.? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds. ... Would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend? As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed."

Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy. Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter \"the Chosen One,\" believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown, although (ctd. page 2, column 5)\nA second newspaper lay beside the first.

The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face. The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck. \"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\" He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder. \"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly.",

Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair. \"Let's move, NOW!\" Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. \"Here,\" said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier.

Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \"ROOKWOOD!\" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. \"Harry, in here!\" Hermione screamed. She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. \"Listen to me - LISTEN, RON!\" \"I wanna help - I wanna kill Death Eaters -\"\nHis face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief."

Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his master.

Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms. Even Hagrid was adding to their workload.

Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their \"project,\" suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior. \"I will not,\" said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack.",

Can't think what would have done it, though. ... Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid's got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls ...\"\nHarry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, \"Do you know how far this owl's traveled, Potter?\" \"Er,\" said Harry. \"From London, I think.\" He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood \"London\" to mean \"number twelve, Grimmauld Place\" by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle.

The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him. \"Impedimenta!\" Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt's armor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over. \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" The skrewt was inches from him when it froze - he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction - the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment. He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing himself to stop, heart hammering, he performed the Four-Point Spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest. He had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead. \"What are you doing?\" yelled Cedric's voice. \"What the hell d'you think you're doing?\"",

Dear Sirius,\nYou told me to keep you posted on what's happening at Hogwarts, so here goes - I don't know if you've heard, but the Tri-wizard Tournament's happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don't know who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn't. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff. He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn't think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,\nHope you're okay, and Buckbeak - Harry\n\"Finished,\" he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out her leg. \"I can't use you,\" Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. \"I've got to use one of these. ...\"\nHedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder.",
            "And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. \"Don't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\" said Harry. Lucius Malfoy rounded on him. \"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said. \"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry.",
            "Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. ... This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's parry before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time. Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \"I told you so,\" which he had done several times to Ron already. Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet."

I have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. ... We needed evidence and the room provided ...\"\nAnd to Harry's horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement's wall and handed it to Fudge.",
            "\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \"Granger, Hermione!\" Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?",
            "Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \"I'll be back in a bit, Luna - er - bathroom.\" \"All right,\" she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested. It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room. ... Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.",
            "\"One - two - three - now!\" A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville. Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes. \"R - r - riddikulus!\" squeaked Neville. There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag. There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, \"Parvati! Forward!\" Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising -\n\"Riddikulus!\" cried Parvati. A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.",
            "\"No way!\" said Harry angrily. \"I see we are of one mind,\" said Dumbledore. \"Certainly, there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death -\"\n\"Hokey confessed?\""

            "The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione's beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now. Harry would gladly have set out for Godric's Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents' deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later - once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together - that Hermione agreed to make the journey. They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione's buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again. Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night's first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village. \"All this snow!\" Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. \"Why didn't we think of snow? After all our precautions, we'll leave prints! We'll just have to get rid of them - you go in front, I'll do it -\"\nHarry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces. \"Let's take off the Cloak,\" said Harry, and when she looked frightened, \"Oh, come on, we don't look like us and there's no one around.\"",
            "Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday. What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream. ...\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes -\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench.

Why was she so upset at breakfast?\" Harry ignored her; he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused. Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry's heart sank at the sight of the crates - surely not another skrewt hatching?",

How could it be jinxed?\" \"Sirius Black,\" Harry said wearily. \"He's supposed to be after me.

            "The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of his arm. \"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. \"It's all a matter of confidence, Harry.\" He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. \"There's this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the news like it really is.

            "The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of his arm. \"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. \"It's all a matter of confidence, Harry.\" He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. \"There's this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they're raided, and you need a password to tune in.",

I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.\" Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape. \"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\" Harry said to Hermione. \"Why's he got it in for Lupin?

            "The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden's frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge. Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand. Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry's eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking. Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake. Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled. \"You're not welcome.\" The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions.",

All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.\" Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes.

As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. ... He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood. \"Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something about the Dark Mark -\" began Ernie Macmillan. \"Out of the way!\" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase."

When they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, \"C'min.\" Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid's lap.

Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said.

The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. ...\nAnd as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind.

Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look anything like his anymore.

To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick. The wardrobe burst into flames. Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.

A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn't hear his own voice -\nAnd then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into focus again -\nHe was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck. \"Hermione, what - ?\" \"In here!\" Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them. \"What - how - Hermione, what happened?\" \"We've gone back in time,\" Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off Harry's neck in the darkness. \"Three hours back ...\"\nHarry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream. \"But -\"\n\"Shh! Listen! Someone's coming! I think - I think it might be us!\"",
            "The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron's expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. ... Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around - but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, \"tweaking the circumstances\"? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry's shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds.",

You idiot - Expecto Patronum!\" Something huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head down, it charged toward the High Street and out of sight. \"That's not what I saw -\" said the Death Eater, though with less certainty."

Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit - he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him. \"What is that supposed to be?\" He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.",
            "This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be - ? \"Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,\" said Hermione, \"but he's not the only one.

Harry's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore's spell - if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the cloak -\n\"Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us -\" screeched the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. \"We've got a problem, Snape,\" said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, \"the boy doesn't seem able -\"\nBut somebody else had spoken Snape's name, quite softly. \"Severus ...\"\nThe sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening.",

You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some -\"\n\"Well, don't bother increasing this, it's disgusting,\" said Ron. \"Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I'm always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I'm a girl, I suppose!\" \"No, it's because you're supposed to be the best at magic!\" shot back Ron.

They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red. \"All right, Harry?"

She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\" Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless. \"Wormtail's body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed.

Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.\" \"And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be 'Wizards first'?\" asked Lee. \"I'd say that it's one short step from 'Wizards first' to 'Purebloods first,' and then to 'Death Eaters,' \" replied Kingsley. \"We're all human, aren't we?

I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he - er - accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.\" \"You're not leaving just because of that!\" said Harry. Lupin smiled wryly. \"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents. ...",
            "...' I mean, why mention it then?\" she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. \"Oh, shut up,\" she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag. The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years' first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds. When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout - the Heads of Houses - and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry.",
            "He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish. \"Good morning,\" said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet. \"My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time -\"\n\"Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!\" barked Professor McGonagall. Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy's rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House. \"- by which time, many of you may be ready to take your tests,\" Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.",
            "Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\" \" 'Extinct in the male line'?\" repeated Ron. \"It means the name's died out,\" said Hermione, \"centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they'd just be called something different.\" And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \"Peverell\": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \"Marvolo Gaunt!\" \"Sorry?\" said Ron and Hermione together. \"Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who's grandfather!",
            "\"You've had ten days to finish it -\"\n\"I only need another two inches, come on -\"\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering. History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn't noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since. Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again."

There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry's knee.\n\" 'Lo, Fawkes,\" said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage.",
            "And then, could you sign it?\" \"Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?\" Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy's voice echoed around the courtyard.

They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeeeeeeeee!\" and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \"Argh!\" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose.",

The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid's cabin looked like an iced cake. Ron knocked, but there was no answer. \"He's not out, is he?\" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak. Ron had his ear to the door.",
            "In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for you. \"But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me - laughing fit to burst - where Sirius had gone.\" \"He was laughing?\" said Harry in a hollow voice. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order's confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius.",
            "When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen. \"Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress's heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns ... and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve ...\n\"And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said ... he said ... The old elf rocked faster than ever. \"... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.\" \"Voldemort needed an elf?\" Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did. \"Oh yes,\" moaned Kreacher. \"And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.\" Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. \"So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake ...\"\nThe hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood up. Kreacher's croaking voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present. \"... There was a boat ...\"\nOf course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf ...\n\"There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it.",
            "Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me. ...\"\nHe held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. \"Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I'm really good at Herbology,\" Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. \"He thought I'd like this.\" Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done. Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry's brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney's fire. \"I haven't got a clue what this lot's supposed to mean,\" he said, staring down at a long list of calculations."

Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively. Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.",

Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, \"Sonorus,\" and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each - Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\" The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. \"In second place, with eighty points - Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\" More applause. \"And in third place - Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\" Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him. \"So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\" said Bagman. \"Three - two - one -\"\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze.

A moment later they heard the front door slam. \"Harry!\" wailed Hermione. \"How could you?\" \"It was easy,\" said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. \"Don't look at me like that!\" he snapped at Hermione. \"Don't you start on her!\" snarled Ron. \"No - no - we mustn't fight!\" said Hermione, launching herself between them. \"You shouldn't have said that stuff to Lupin,\" Ron told Harry. \"He had it coming to him,\" said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother's voice, begging for mercy ...\n\"Parents,\" said Harry, \"shouldn't leave their kids unless - unless they've got to.\" \"Harry -\" said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin's tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse.",

The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred's body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred's chest, her body shaking, Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.

Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron. \"Harry's got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\" she said seriously. \"If that was the first task, I hate to think what's coming next.\"",

Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever. \"We saw it,\" said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. \"It happened just after we broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort - he can fly - went straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort's curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and - there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail -\"\nBill's voice broke. \"Of course you couldn't have done anything,\" said Lupin.

Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories. He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall. They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall. \"Oh bravo!\" cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. \"Very good indeed!

Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, \"He scares the other children.\" \"You mean he is a bully?\" asked Dumbledore. \"I think he must be,\" said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, \"but it's very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. ... Nasty things ...\"\nDumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested.

The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind. The clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp's lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly. They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from both ankles. He opened his mouth even wider.",

All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\""

Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny? He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. \"Ginny!\"",

He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward. Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened - he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail's anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.

            "Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him. Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans ... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly:\n\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts.

            "Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next. Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood. \"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!\" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.",
            "\"A ... a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord ...\"\nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret? The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup -\nAlone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality - the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy -\nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than ghost. ... No, surely, the rest were safe. ... The other Horcruxes must be intact. ... But he must know, he must be sure.",
            "Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn't believe half of them - for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group. Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions - as Binns hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn't going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy's cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry.",

The door opened. Dumbledore's back appeared. \"I am going to lock you in,\" they heard him saying. \"It is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\" Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock it.",

Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. \"We have already placed protection around the castle,\" Professor McGonagall was saying, \"but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -\"\nBut her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clear: There was no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries. \"I know that you are preparing to fight.\" There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound.",

Wouldn't hear a word against him!\" \"I'd love to know what Snape told him to convince him,\" said Tonks. \"I know,\" said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. \"Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead.\" They all stared at him. \"And Dumbledore believed that?\" said Lupin incredulously. \"Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. ...\"\n\"And he didn't think my mother was worth a damn either,\" said Harry, \"because she was Muggle-born. ... 'Mudblood,' he called her. ...\"\nNobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened. \"This is all my fault,\" said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands.",
            "He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,\" said Umbridge smugly. \"He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me -\"\n\"Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \"What an interesting insight into our justice system!\" \"Blatant corruption!\" roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk. \"The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!\" \"Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,\" said Dumbledore softly. \"The purpose of Potter's meeting with these students,\" continued Professor Umbridge, \"was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age -\"\n\"I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,\" said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose.

At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \"Hey, Potter, come down!\" Oliver Wood had arrived.",

DON'T KILL HIM!\" Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second's hesitation was all Harry needed. \"Expelliarmus!\" Goyle's wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione's second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, \"Avada Kedavra!\" again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light.

Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, \"That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\" Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.",
            "Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went. Shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched. Filch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with horror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver; it whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee. Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds.

Then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and put his face down into the horse's silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a bloodred sunset. Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: The thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating. The cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked around and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from its slipstream. They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade. Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. In the falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills. ...\n\"This is bizarre!\"",

Take my body back to my parents. ...\"\n\"I will,\" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand. \"Do it now,\" whispered his father's voice, \"be ready to run ... do it now. ...\"\n\"NOW!\" Harry yelled; he didn't think he could have held on for another moment anyway - he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died - but the shadowy figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear - they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze -\nAnd Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones - he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do -\n\"Stun him!\" he heard Voldemort scream. Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it.

Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door. Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card. Dear Harry,\nHappy birthday!

About you.\" Harry's confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?",
            "\"A map of the campsite for you,\" Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley. \"And your change.\" \"Thanks very much,\" said Mr. Weasley. The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, \"Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman's not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I'll be glad when this is over.",
            "said Harry. \"Oh yes,\" Winky said, nodding her head furiously. \"My master is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying ... Winky - Winky keeps her master's secrets. ...\"\nShe dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \"Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more! They couldn't get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages. \"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\" he said happily, pointing at his bare chest. \"Tell you what, Dobby,\" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \"I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don't mind maroon, do you?\" Dobby was delighted. \"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\" Ron told him, \"but it'll go well with your tea cozy.\" As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies. \"Thanks a lot!\" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night."

            "Hops ahead - people follow the light - then -\"\nThe hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass. When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but -\n\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I'd like a word.\" Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's box with a cloth. \"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I'm sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits.\" Lupin sighed. \"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance. \"Did you hear about the dementors too?\"",
            "\"We're just waiting for the signal to tell us it's safe to set off,\" said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. \"We've got about fifteen minutes.\" \"Very clean, aren't they, these Muggles?\" said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. \"My dad's Muggle-born and he's a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just like with wizards?\" \"Er - yeah,\" said Harry. \"Look\" - he turned back to Lupin - \"what's going on, I haven't heard anything from anyone, what's Vol - ?\"",
            "\"HAGRID!\" He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway. \"Oh my - !\" shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above. \"DON'T!\" Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her wand. \"Stun him and he'll crush half the castle -\"\n\"HAGGER?\" Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions. \"RUN!\" Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione's hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again. The air around them had frozen: Harry's breath caught and solidified in his chest.",
            "Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his life. \"Just come out - prototype -\" a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion. \"It's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, Dad?\" squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father's arm. \"Irish International Side's just put in an order for seven of these beauties!\" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. \"And they're favorites for the World Cup!\" A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom:\nTHE FIREBOLT\nThis state-of-the-art racing broom sports a stream-lined, superfine handle of ash, treated with a diamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its own registration number. Each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection, giving the Firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision. The Firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable Braking Charm.",
            "The basilisk!\" \"What the - ?\" \"Something to get rid of Horcruxes,\" said Ron simply. Harry's eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione's arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. \"But how did you get in there?\""

She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand as he watched her. \"You are forcing me, Potter. ... I do not want to,\" said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, \"but sometimes circumstances justify the use ... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice. ...\"\nMalfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face. \"The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,\" said Umbridge quietly. \"No!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Professor Umbridge - it's illegal\" - but Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand.",
            "\"If you accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors -\"\n\"Preposterous!\" shouted Fudge again. \"Remove the dementors? I'd be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!\" \"The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!\" said Dumbledore. \"They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!\" Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage. \"The second step you must take - and at once,\" Dumbledore pressed on, \"is to send envoys to the giants.\" \"Envoys to the giants?\" Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again.",
            "'Spew'?\" said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. \"What's this about?\" \"Not spew,\" said Hermione impatiently. \"It's S-P-E-W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.\"",
            "\"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might've been Bill. ...\"\n\"And what on earth's a Squib?\" said Harry.

He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full-length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would he write?",

But Master Regulus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns ... and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve ...\n\"And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said ... he said ... The old elf rocked faster than ever. \"... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.\" \"Voldemort needed an elf?\" Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did. \"Oh yes,\" moaned Kreacher. \"And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.\" Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. \"So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake ...\"\nThe hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood up. Kreacher's croaking voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present. \"... There was a boat ...\"\nOf course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf ...\n\"There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it.",
            "The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. Within a week, even those who had been eyewitnesses were half-convinced that they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms, pelting her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them, so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like, \"Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,\" or else, \"One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley. ...\"\nFred and George had made sure that nobody was likely to forget them very soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle. Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters.",
            "\"Longbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can't even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!\" Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus. When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers' table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them. \"It's a bummer, all right,\" George was saying gloomily to Fred. \"But if he won't talk to us in person, we'll have to send him the letter after all.

            "Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. \"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off. ...\"\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself. \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. ... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand - the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors.",
            "He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. \"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?\" whispered Hermione. \"Maybe you can't rebuild it?\" Harry replied. \"Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can't repair the damage?\" He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house. \"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might - oh, Harry, look!\" His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said:\nOn this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter lost their lives.",

Snape's lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry. \"The headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.\" \"Study what?\" said Harry blankly.

It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness.

            "'Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric's Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.'"

Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron's father. \"Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\" The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm. \"They're all right, they're all right!\" she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.",

Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.\" There seemed to be very little air in Harry's lungs, his breathing was quick and shallow. \"And Kreacher told you all this ... and laughed?\" he croaked. \"He did not wish to tell me,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I - persuaded him - to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.\" \"And,\" whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, \"and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him -\"\n\"She was quite right, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.",

The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges' vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed Griphook. The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work.",

He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other. \"You've been ages,\" said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys' tents. \"Met a few people,\" said Ron, setting the water down. \"You not got that fire started yet?\" \"Dad's having fun with the matches,\" said Fred. Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life. \"Oops!\" he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise. \"Come here, Mr. Weasley,\" said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly.",

He raised his wand and murmured \"Portus\"; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever. Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore's voice when he attempted to rouse him. \"Phineas. Phineas.\" And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening.

Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned; Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard's hat at once.",

There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.",

Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me.\"",

Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. \"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Then shake,\" said the goblin, holding out his hand.

In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance -\"\n\"- you can't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,\" said Harry quickly. \"Hermione Granger told me.\" \"And she is quite right.

Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.",

Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole's desktop. \"Here,\" said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, \"I think this will make everything clear.\" Mrs. Cole's eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment. \"That seems perfectly in order,\" she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before. \"Er - may I offer you a glass of gin?\" she said in an extra-refined voice. \"Thank you very much,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn't hesitate to press his advantage. \"I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle's history?

Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -\"\n\"None of us could break through,\" said Ron, \"and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. ...\"\n\"And then Snape was there,\" said Tonks, \"and then he wasn't -\"\n\"I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eater's jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,\" said Ginny. \"I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn't there,\" said Lupin. \"I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville. ...\"\n\"He must have known a spell we didn't,\" whispered McGonagall. \"After all - he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ...

In any case, Harry didn't like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments' pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen-year-old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar. Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like - someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. ...\nAnd then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn't believe it had taken so long - Sirius. Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away.

The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again. Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron's head. \"Well, I don't know what you expected, Ron, but you -\"\n\"Don't tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron.",
            "A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face - with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy's gaunt, petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.",
            "Harry remained kneeling at Snape's side, simply staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room. Voldemort's voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away. \"You have fought,\" said the high, cold voice, \"valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. \"Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. \"Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. \"You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. \"I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you."

            "Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.",

Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them. When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries.",

He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends' offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was leaving. They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron's departure.",

You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it.

They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull. \"You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,\" Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall's long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra's equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter's moons. \"Yeah,\" said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. \"Listen ... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she's done?\" Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks. \"No,\" he said heavily, \"you know she won't let us.\" And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again.

He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury.

He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground. \"Hagrid!\" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. \"Hagrid - Accio Hagrid!\" The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, \"Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!\" He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more -\nAnd then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him.

If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore's protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters. Harry's nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.

Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.

Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their first-ever Potions lesson? \"A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.\" It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars. He opened the box just as Slughorn called, \"Two minutes left, everyone!\" Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his cauldron. \"Time's ... UP!\" called Slughorn genially. \"Well, let's see how you've done!

They couldn't get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages. \"Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\" he said happily, pointing at his bare chest. \"Tell you what, Dobby,\" said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \"I'll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don't mind maroon, do you?\" Dobby was delighted. \"We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\" Ron told him, \"but it'll go well with your tea cozy.\" As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies. \"Thanks a lot!\" Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night.",
            "Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight. It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however. \"Let's see,\" he said, in his silkiest voice. \"Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it'll be a week's worth of detentions.\""

But I think you know my Luna?\" he added to Ron. \"Yes,\" said Ron. \"Isn't she with you?\" \"She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes - or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.\" \"Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,\" said Ron, \"but I think Fred and George taught them those.\" He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. \"Hello, Harry!\" she said.",

Personally, I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. ...\"\n\"Harry!\" said Hermione, shocked and reproachful. \"He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,\" said Ron reasonably. \"That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term.",
            "said Harry. \"No,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?\" \"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\" said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for the book. Just then, there was a rustle at the window and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight in her beak. \"It's from Hagrid,\" said Harry, ripping the note open. \"Buckbeak's appeal - it's set for the sixth.\" \"That's the day we finish our exams,\" said Hermione, still looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book. \"And they're coming up here to do it,\" said Harry, still reading from the letter. \"Someone from the Ministry of Magic and - and an executioner.\" Hermione looked up, startled. \"They're bringing the executioner to the appeal! But that sounds as though they've already decided!\" \"Yeah, it does,\" said Harry slowly. \"They can't!\" Ron howled.",
            "\"You're still doing really well, though,\" Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. \"Some of these are bound to come in handy.\" \"Come and look at this,\" said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was staring down onto the grounds. \"What's Malfoy doing?\" Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below.",

We've got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station -\"\n\"Is Tonks going to be there?\" asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things. \"No, I don't think so, she's been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.\" \"She has let 'erself go, zat Tonks,\" Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. \"A big mistake if you ask -\"\n\"Yes, thank you,\" said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again."

            "Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach. \"Where are we burying him?\" he asked. \"The forest?\" \"Blimey, no,\" said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. \"The other spiders won' let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog's gone. Turns out it was on'y on his orders they didn' eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?\" The honest answer was \"yes\"; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid. \"Never bin an area o' the forest I couldn' go before!\" said Hagrid, shaking his head.",
            "Dennis's guess was closer. ... As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. The front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed - then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year's foot, the horses' hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes. Harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened. A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage - a shoe the size of a child's sled - followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped. Harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow - maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid - this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers. Dumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman. Her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand.",
            "\"I've heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.\" \"What was the werewolf's name?\" said Harry quickly. \"Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,\" said Hermione. \"I knew it - the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!\" said Harry angrily. Hermione looked at him bleakly. \"Harry, you've got to get that memory,\" she said. \"It's all about stopping Voldemort, isn't it?",
            "But he hoped she'd be back soon - she was the only living creature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him. Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had been - stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning. Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary of all.",
            "The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, they had those lessons free. They used the one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly. \"Who's that?\" called Hagrid, coming to the door."

Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeeeeeeeee!\" and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \"Argh!\" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose.",
            "Rookwood scurried backward, bowing, and disappeared through a door. Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry moved toward it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness. ... A face whiter than a skull ... red eyes with slits for pupils ... \"NOOOOOOOOO!\" \"What?\" yelled a voice nearby. Harry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced that he was about to see the white, skull-like face looming at him out of the dark again, then Ron's voice spoke very near to him.",
            "Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying -\"\n\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered. \"- and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.\" \"And it's really none of your business,\" said Harry. \"Good-bye,\" said Ron. All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it. \"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we'd better go.\" They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.\" A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.",
            "It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside. \"No - no -\" Harry gasped. \"He's innocent ... expecto - expecto patronum -\"\nHe could feel them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it raised both its rotting hands - and lowered its hood. Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth ... a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak. His Patronus flickered and died. White fog was blinding him. He had to fight ... expecto patronum ... he couldn't see ... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming ... expecto patronum ... he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm ... they weren't going to take him. ... But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry's neck.",
            "\"I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don't you?\" Dobby bowed his head. \"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir\" - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard ...\"\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\" \"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. \"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\""

            "So listen to them!\" \"No one's tried to attack me all year,\" said Harry. \"No one's done anything to me at all -\"\n\"Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,\" said Hermione. \"And they must've done that for a reason, Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they've been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they're going to get you.\" \"Look,\" said Harry impatiently, \"let's say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch.",
            "A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read AUROR HEADQUARTERS. Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. \"Morning, Weasley,\" said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \"I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\" \"Yes, if it really is a second,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"I'm in rather a hurry.\" They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle. Harry received a slight shock; Sirius's face was blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs - even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding - papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. \"Here,\" said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, \"I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\" Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \"Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\"",
            "* * *\nThe cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. \"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But Professor - he's gone and landed himself in detention again -\"\n\"What's this, Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" \"From Professor Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. \"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?\" \"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor.",
            "said Bill incredulously. \"Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!\" \"Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,\" said Sirius. \"So what's the Order been doing?\" said Harry, looking around at them all. \"Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can't carry out his plans,\" said Sirius. \"How d'you know what his plans are?\" Harry asked quickly. \"Dumbledore's got a shrewd idea,\" said Lupin, \"and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.\" \"So what does Dumbledore reckon he's planning?\" \"Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,\" said Sirius.",
            "Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so. The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" Harry's body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm -\nThen, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood. ... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself. Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, \"Good evening, Draco.\" Malfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom. \"Who else is here?\" \"A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?\" Harry saw Malfoy's pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark. \"No,\" he said. \"I've got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.\" \"Well, well,\" said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project."

            "Hagrid called. \"Show yerself - I'm armed!\" And into the clearing came - was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.",
            "Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him. \"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry's way. Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out. With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting.",
            "While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse. Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one. \"Scary-lookin' fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read. \"He murdered thirteen people?\" said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, \"with one curse?\" \"Yep,\" said Stan, \"in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\" \"Ar,\" said Ern darkly. Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry. \"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo,\" he said. \"What, Voldemort?\"",
            "\"Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.\" \"It'll be one of those goblin stories,\" said Ron, \"about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for one of our wands.\" \"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"They've been treated brutally in the past.\" \"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?\" said Ron. \"They've killed plenty of us. They've fought dirty too.\" \"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn't going to make him more likely to help us, is it?\" There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. \"Okay,\" said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, \"how's this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There's a fake in there, isn't there? We switch them, and give him the fake.\"",
            "He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before."

            "\"Good,\" said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. \"Which leaves ... Mr. Potter.\" Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed over his wand. \"Aaaah, yes,\" said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. \"Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.\" Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday.",
            "Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual. \"Pajama party, is it?\" he growled up the stairs. \"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,\" said Filch at once. \"Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual - and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off -\"\n\"Shut up!\" Snape hissed to Filch. Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody's magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself. Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again. \"Did I hear that correctly, Snape?\" he asked slowly. \"Someone broke into your office?\" \"It is unimportant,\" said Snape coldly. \"On the contrary,\" growled Moody, \"it is very important. Who'd want to break into your office?\" \"A student, I daresay,\" said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape's greasy temple. \"It has happened before."

            "Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years. \"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two -\"\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips. \"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle - twelve feet - twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -\nWHAM - a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy - it's all right, up you get.\" She turned to the rest of the class. \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\" Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.",

Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts -\"\n\"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\" said Snape.",
            "\"Lovely, madam,\" squeaked Hokey. Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey's contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped. \"Quick, quick, he's here, Hokey!\" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.",
            "He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn't been her fault at all, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius's death; it was no more her fault than anyone else's (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks's long cloak whispering on the ground behind them. Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut."

Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural? The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading. It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, \"The dementors send their love, Potter!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students. \"Why isn't anyone going in?\" said Ron curiously. Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed.",

Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it - once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead -\nKatie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. Madam Hooch was beside herself.",
            "This cheered up Harry very slightly. ...\nWhat wouldn't he have given to be one of these people, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn't come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn't be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He'd have been really looking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was ... cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands. ... He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled.",
            "They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later. After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L. results. \"Herbology, fine,\" she said. \"Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T level. I just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework.\"",
            "I'll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.\" Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea."

            "\"I'm going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?\" \"We found it - we found it - PLEASE!\" Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry's wrist. \"Ron, please stay still!\"",
            "\"Yes, sir,\" said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand. \"Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\" said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \"into offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. \"Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley -\"\n\"- Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\" said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck. Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose. The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome. A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him.",
            "\"Malfoy's not doing prefect duty. He's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\" Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year. \"What did he do when he saw you?\" \"The usual,\" said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand gesture. \"Not like him, though, is it? Well - that is\" - he did the hand gesture again - \"but why isn't he out there bullying first years?",
            "\"I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?\" asked Parvati, smirking. It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning. \"Not really,\" said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet."

After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.",

She said the servant would help him come back to power.\" Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \"And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said. Was it - was she making a real prediction? Dumbledore looked mildly impressed. \"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise. ...\"\n\"But -\" Harry looked at him, aghast.

Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour's droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye. \"How would it be,\" she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), \"if I refused to lend you my notes this year?\" \"We'd fail our O.W.L.s,\" said Ron. \"If you want that on your conscience, Hermione ...\"\n\"Well, you'd deserve it,\" she snapped. \"You don't even try to listen to him, do you?\" \"We do try,\" said Ron. \"We just haven't got your brains or your memory or your concentration - you're just cleverer than we are - is it nice to rub it in?\" \"Oh, don't give me that rubbish,\" said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard. A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward them. \"Hello, Harry!\" It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball. \"Hi,\" said Harry, feeling his face grow hot."

Harry stopped to let him walk through first. \"Thank you,\" said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him. And then Karkaroff froze.

Karkaroff's eyes moved slowly up Harry's face and fixed upon his scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry's forehead. \"Yeah, that's Harry Potter,\" said a growling voice from behind them. Professor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster.

Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn't doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind. They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session.

Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around - but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione's help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn't do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, \"tweaking the circumstances\"? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry's shoulder every time he saw Ginny.

The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron's reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on.

            "\"One - two - three - now!\" A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville. Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes. \"R - r - riddikulus!\" squeaked Neville. There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag. There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, \"Parvati! Forward!\" Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising -\n\"Riddikulus!\" cried Parvati. A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.",
            "At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream. Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley's tongue - and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him. Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off."

It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. \"Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,\" Harry said. \"No, no, I'm sure it's fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \"Let's see ... six ...\" he dialed the number, \"two ... four ... and another four ... and another two ...\"\nAs the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them. \"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.

Somebody had removed his glasses.",
            "Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn't visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn't hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. \"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier. Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed. \"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone. \"Let's go together, we've only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry. Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and -\nCRASH. Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\" \"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.",
            "\"I can show you, if you like,\" came Riddle's reply. \"You don't have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.\" Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.",
            "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over - and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. \"Is it - dead?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Harry, \"I think it's just been knocked out.\" He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \"Urgh - troll boogers.\" He wiped it on the troll's trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.",
            "And we saw the Devil's Snare arrive. She - the Healer - said it was a Christmas present. ...\"\nHarry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat. \"How come we didn't recognize Devil's Snare ... ? We've seen it before ... we could've stopped this from happening ...\"\n\"Who expects Devil's Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant?\" said Ron sharply. \"It's not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn't they check what they were buying?\" \"Oh come on, Ron!\" said Hermione shakily, \"I don't think anyone could put Devil's Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it? This - this was murder. ... A clever murder, as well. ... If the plant was sent anonymously, how's anyone ever going to find out who did it?\""

The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore's wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore's wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock. Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air. Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling. \"Yes, this is the place,\" said Dumbledore. \"How can you tell?\" Harry spoke in a whisper. \"It has known magic,\" said Dumbledore simply. Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments.",

He never defeated Dumbledore.\" \"He killed -\"\n\"Aren't you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore's death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand's last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand's power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!\" \"But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\" Voldemort's voice shook with malicious pleasure. \"I stole the wand from its last master's tomb! I removed it against its last master's wishes! Its power is mine!\" \"You still don't get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn't enough! Holding it, using it, doesn't make it really yours.",
            "Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. \"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry. \"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\n\"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\nYou're killing off students, you think it's good fun -\"\n\"That's enough, Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.",
            "Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself. Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them - but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes. Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms. Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their \"project,\" suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior. \"I will not,\" said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack.",

He'd see Justin the next day in Herbology and he'd explain that he'd been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized. By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey. Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess. \"For heaven's sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron's bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board.",

Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely \"passable.\" The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once. \"Sir,\" Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could. \"Professor - Professor, don't you want to taste my po - ?\" called Harry desperately.

Let's give it till break.\" History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too.

            "Where was it kept? Who had it now? \"Mimbulus mimbletonia,\" said Ron's voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room. It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore too.",

Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, \"That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.\" \"Oh, it's nothing, dear,\" she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane.

From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery - particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue. ...\n\"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn't much life left in her. ... She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last. ...",

He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt very sick. \"Something he's been hoping for.\" The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry's mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time. \"Hermione told me to come and check on you,\" said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet. \"She says your defenses will be low at the moment, after Snape's been fiddling around with your mind.",
            "He's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a basilisk in there.\" Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart's office. There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through it.",
            "...\"\nHe pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest. Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had his bag and the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go. One landing down from Umbridge's office and Harry thought it was safe to become visible again; he pulled off the cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there. It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd.",
            "Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest. \"We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\" said Professor McGonagall to the champions.",
            "Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy's jaw; looking down he saw the Snitch's silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release. They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall's office when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode toward them, looking livid. \"In!\" she said furiously, pointing to the door."

            "But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.\" \"Was he killed by an Auror?\" Harry asked tentatively. \"Oh no,\" said Sirius. \"No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It's a lifetime of service or death.\" \"Lunch,\" said Mrs. Weasley's voice. She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.",
            "\"W-what's that?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"You-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny's not ... Ginny hasn't been ... has she?\" \"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen. ...\"\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages. \"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered. \"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle.",
            "\"He must have sent them,\" said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon. \"What's that? Who must have sent them?\" \"Lord Voldemort,\" said Harry. He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like \"wizard,\" \"magic,\" or \"wand,\" could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor. \"Lord - hang on,\" said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. \"I've heard that name ... that was the one who ...\"\n\"Murdered my parents, yes,\" Harry said. \"But he's gone,\" said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry's parents might be a painful topic to anybody. \"That giant bloke said so. He's gone.\" \"He's back,\" said Harry heavily. It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia's surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry's two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and he might never go back to Hogwarts. Harry's head throbbed more painfully. \"Back?\" whispered Aunt Petunia. She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before.",
            "\"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I've noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he's up to. He thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's heir single-handed.\" He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.",
            "Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned. \"You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!\" she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. \"Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer -\"\n\"We don't take O.W.L.s till fifth year!\" said Dean Thomas indignantly. \"Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion.

            "Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn't say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat. At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year. \"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table. \"As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.",
            "Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, \"I've become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won't you?\" Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library. Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor's chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski.",

Oh yeah - and they told me to tell you you've got to hang around for a few more minutes. ... Bagman wants a word, back in the champions' tent.\" Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how he'd felt while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he'd walked out to face it. ... There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse. Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric's face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn.",

It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they - and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione - were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it. \"D'you reckon we should tell someone?\" Harry asked Ron. \"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's,\" said Ron dismissively \"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into.\" Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.",

A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres -\nHarry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them -\n\"Colloportus!\"",

In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin. \"Noticed, have you?\" said Fred's voice. He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses. \"Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points,\" said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor hourglass."

Moody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons. \"I don't think so!\" roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again - it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more. \"I don't like people who attack when their opponent's back's turned,\" growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. \"Stinking, cowardly, scummy thing to do. ...\"\nThe ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly. \"Never - do - that - again -\" said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again. \"Professor Moody!\" said a shocked voice. Professor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books. \"Hello, Professor McGonagall,\" said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher. \"What - what are you doing?\" said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret's progress through the air. \"Teaching,\" said Moody. \"Teach - Moody, is that a student?\" shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms. \"Yep,\" said Moody. \"No!\" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing. \"Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!\" said Professor McGonagall weakly. \"Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?\"",

Then he shrugged. \"Still ... the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix!

Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harry's words. \"Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,\" he muttered grudgingly. \"And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend ... in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus. ...

You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.\" \"What's that?\" \"They call it the Dementor's Kiss,\" said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. \"It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and - and suck out his soul.\"",

We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\" \"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold. \"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\" Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand.

He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort. ... He had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now. ...\nAnd then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents. ...\n\"What's he after apart from followers?\"",
            "Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face. \"What d'you mean, she won't wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She's not - she's not - ?\" \"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\" Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. \"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly. \"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\"",
            "Eyewitnesses - Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later - told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing, 'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?' And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens. ...\"\nProfessor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, \"Stupid boy ... foolish boy ... he was always hopeless at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry. ...\"\n\"I tell yeh, if I'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I wouldn't've messed around with wands - I'd've ripped him limb - from - limb,\" Hagrid growled. \"You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid,\" said Fudge sharply.",
            "\"Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!\" Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened. \"The others - everyone at the wedding -\"\n\"We can't worry about that now,\" whispered Hermione. \"It's you they're after, Harry, and we'll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.\" \"She's right,\" said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his face.",
            "\"We'll - we'll find a way to repair it.\" \"Harry, I don't think we're going to be able to,\" said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. \"Remember ... remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to get a new one.\" Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? \"Well,\" he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, \"well, I'll just borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch.\" Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her."

To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. \"Well - it's not funny really - but as it's Filch,\" he said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any magic powers.",
            "\"Merlin's beard, keep it down!\" said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \"Under that cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\" \"I'm sorry!\" Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them. \"I just - oh, Hagrid!\" \"It's nuthin', it's nuthin'!\"",

At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon. \"I'll carry that owl, if you like,\" said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.",

            "Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there ... and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew. ...\n\"If you don't mind, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, \"I'd like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?\" Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard.",

He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. \"Act now, act now,\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"the Imperius Curse!\" Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, \"Imperio!\" A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" \"What?\" said Hermione. \"No, no, that's mine -\"\n\"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. \"But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \"Imperio!\" once more. \"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't you?\" Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached. \"I shall need the Clankers,\" he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. \"Good, good!",
            "Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading. Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley's arm. \"One moment, Runcorn.\" The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, \"I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.\" Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley's anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. \"Sorry?\" he said. \"Don't pretend, Runcorn,\" said Mr. Weasley fiercely. \"You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn't you?\" \"I - so what if I did?\"",

They had almost unloaded Moody's luggage cart when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin. \"No trouble?\" growled Moody. \"Nothing,\" said Lupin. \"I'll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,\" said Moody. \"That's the second time he's not turned up in a week.",

Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential - everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville's turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville's parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies."

Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people - the Minister really could not be more gracious to me - and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents' beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.

Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape's dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food. \"Oh hang on ...\" said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. \"Wait a minute, Hermione. ...\"\n\"What?\" She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face. \"I know what this is about,\" said Harry.

In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's - er ...\"\n\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg.",

I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\" \"But then - ?\" \"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\" These words did nothing to raise Harry's morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \"Voldemort's mistake, Harry, Voldemort's mistake ... Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.",
            "\"When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise.

So does that mean we're using the Galleons?\" There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. \"You know what these remind me of?\"",

We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!\" \"You know,\" said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, \"this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything.

Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning. ...\"\n\"He is planning something to do with me, then?\" said Harry swiftly.",

I've been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house - the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands - it's been very pleasant, I'll be sorry to leave.

Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field. \"Meet us upstairs,\" Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. \"After everyone's gone to bed.\" Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, and R.A.B. 's locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly.",

Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He's not serious?\""

Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!\" It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all. \"Accio! Accio!",

            "The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. \"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said you'd go to the deathday party.\" So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.",

Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell -\"\n\"Hem, hem.\" \"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. \"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So - you know the incantation, let me see what you can do.",
            "As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees. The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly. \"Shut up, Pig,\" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \"Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\" he told Harry. \"Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work.\""

Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood - an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:\nDOLORES UMBRIDGE\nSENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER\nBelow that, a slightly shinier new plaque read:\nHEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\nHarry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground.",

But, sir\" - Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper - \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't ... powers no decent wizard ...\"\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\" \"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. \"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\"",
            "\"I am here, as I'm sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will.\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. \"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?\" \"A-all of us?\" said Ron. \"Me and Hermione too?\" \"Yes, all of -\"\nBut Harry interrupted. \"Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?\" \"Isn't it obvious?\" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \"They wanted to examine whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!\" she said, and her voice trembled slightly. \"I had every right,\" said Scrimgeour dismissively. \"The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will -\"\n\"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\" said Hermione, \"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before seizing them!",

Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it. \"Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry nervously. \"I keep this,\" said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \"You get this back,\" he added, thrusting the wand at Harry."

He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything - the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out - that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius's handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon's ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius's message. Arthur's just told us what's happened. Don't leave the house again, whatever you do.

Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises - or even Invisibility Cloaks,\" he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \"It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses.

It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes. He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring.",

He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection. They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder's Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's name in the girls' dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right. By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor's sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became.",

Twilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were traveling. Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would cause him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr. Weasley was attacked.",

Then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do. ... He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand, and cried, \"Expecto Patronum!\" A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry's wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. ...

He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape's aspersions on his father's character. Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head. ... He was as bad, wasn't he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it ... not unless they really loathed them ... Perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it ...\nHarry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands - but hadn't Lily asked, \"What's he done to you?\" And hadn't James replied, \"It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean?\" Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius said he was bored?

            "\"Oh,\" said Ron, the smile fading from his face. \"Yeah ...\"\n\"So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?\" Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig. \"Just a couple of people,\" Hermione repeated, checking her watch and then looking anxiously toward the door. \"I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh look, this might be them now -\"\nThe door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people. First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise. \"A couple of people?\" said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. \"A couple of people?\" \"Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,\" said Hermione happily.",

Anyway, the St. Mungo's staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.\" \"Where were you this weekend, sir?\" Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly. \"I would rather not say just now,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, I shall tell you in due course.\"",

Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty.

Times of individual appointments are listed below. Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half-past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the career information that had been left there for their perusal. \"Well, I don't fancy Healing,\" said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungo's on its front. \"It says here you need at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts.",

Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of Harry's predictions. \"About time!\" said Harry, hurrying after her. \"She's got an answer!\" said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig's leg. Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly. \"What does it say?\" Hermione asked breathlessly.

            "The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expected. \"He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters. \"I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort's wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius's wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort's own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy's stand?\" \"But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\" asked Harry. \"My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,\" Dumbledore finished kindly. Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here. \"He killed me with your wand.\" \"He failed to kill you with my wand,\" Dumbledore corrected Harry. \"I think we can agree that you are not dead - though, of course,\" he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \"I do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\"",

Lupin nodded. \"But surely people realize what's going on?\" \"The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\" said Lupin. \"The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\"",
            "As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own.",

Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\" \"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning.\"",

His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown. Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror. While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature. In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding.

As if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown. Bloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror. While many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa's son appears to have inherited her brutal nature. In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants. Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.",
            "\"- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another -\"\n\"- which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.\" \"A very good chance, then,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Potter has a criminal record,\" said Umbridge loudly. \"Potter has been cleared of all charges,\" said Professor McGonagall, even more loudly. Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister. \"Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!\" Professor McGonagall got to her feet too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move."

            "Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn't want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window. He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask.",
            "\"Yes, sir,\" said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand. \"Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\" said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \"into offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. \"Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley -\"\n\"- Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\" said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck. Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose. The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome. A powerful emotion had risen in Harry's chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him.",
            "If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents. ...\nHarry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance. ... The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised, Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest.",
            "\"- and You-Know-Who's chasing the third, but he doesn't realize ... he just thinks it's a powerful wand -\"\n\"Harry,\" said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily's letter, \"I'm sorry, but I think you've got this wrong, all wrong.\" \"But don't you see? It all fits -\"\n\"No, it doesn't,\" she said. \"It doesn't, Harry, you're just getting carried away. Please,\" she said as he started to speak, \"please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death - Harry, why wouldn't he have told you?",
            "\"I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?' \"\n\"Er,\" said Harry, \"were you?\" \"Just as modest as Horace described!\" said Worple. \"But seriously\" - his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike - \"I would be delighted to write it myself - people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you - ask Sanguini here if it isn't quite - Sanguini, stay here!\""

He reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.

It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man's eyes that made him frightening. One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye - and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man's head, so that all they could see was whiteness.

            "Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she'd had a job. When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks. The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present. \"Harry Potter is too good to Dobby!\" he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes. \"You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,\" said Harry.",

Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. \"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?\" \" 'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,' \" said Lupin calmly. Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \"It's him, I've checked!\" \"All right, all right!\" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak. \"But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\" \"So it seems,\" replied Lupin, \"but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.\" \"Small comfort!\" snarled Kingsley.",
            "Not from wand-carriers.\" \"Wand-carriers,\" repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. \"The right to carry a wand,\" said the goblin quietly, \"has long been contested between wizards and goblins.\" \"Well, goblins can do magic without wands,\" said Ron. \"That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\" \"Well, goblins won't share any of their magic either,\" said Ron. \"You won't tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never -\"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Harry, noting Griphook's rising color. \"This isn't about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature -\"\nGriphook gave a nasty laugh. \"But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?\" \"We do!\" said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \"We protest!",
            "...\n\"Er ... Professor Moody ... why d'you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape's office?\" Moody's magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him. \"Put it this way, Potter,\" Moody muttered finally, \"they say old Mad-Eye's obsessed with catching Dark wizards ... but I'm nothing - nothing - compared to Barty Crouch.\" He continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more. \"Professor Moody?\" he said again. \"D'you think ... could this have anything to do with ... maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there's something going on. ...\"\n\"Like what?\" said Moody sharply. Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn't want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.",

Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. \"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry. \"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\n\"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\nYou're killing off students, you think it's good fun -\"\n\"That's enough, Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.",

The ancient skills unique to the Wizarding community must be passed down through the generations lest we lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.\" Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGonagall's dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little \"Hem, hem\" and went on with her speech. \"Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay. There again, progress for progress's sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation ...\"\nHarry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect's badge gleaming on his chest. Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste. \"... because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned.

            "\"They weren't thieving,\" said Harry. \"That sword isn't Snape's.\" \"It belongs to Professor Snape's school,\" said Phineas Nigellus. \"Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!\" \"Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!\" said Hermione. \"Where am I?\" repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. \"Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?\"",

Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of invisible dementors?\" Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh. \"Oh, very good, Minister, very good!\" Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently too. \"Cornelius, I do not deny - and nor, I am sure, does Harry - that he was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the Hog's Head at all.\" Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy.

Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned. \"That is a valuable object,\" said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \"It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?\" Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. \"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\" Scrimgeour persevered. \"Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three.

            "Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape. \"I was wondering,\" Hermione said suddenly, \"whether you'd thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.\" \" 'Course I have,\" said Harry grumpily. \"Can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us -\"\n\"I meant the idea Ron and I had\" - Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him - \"oh, all right, the idea I had, then - about you teaching us.\" Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind. The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters - found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons."

If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.\" \"Tell him what?\" Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.",

Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel. But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort's wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort's wand were flooding into his mind.

Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\" And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.

Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider's underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted \"Stupefy!\" just as Cedric yelled the same thing. The two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs. \"Harry!\" he heard Cedric shouting. \"You all right?

One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure.

            "\"And where would it take me?\" \"On,\" said Dumbledore simply. Silence again. \"Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.\" \"True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\" \"But you want me to go back?\" \"I think,\" said Dumbledore, \"that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\" Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair. \"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.\""

What will happen to those who call themselves - or so rumor has it - the Death Eaters?\" Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort's eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare. \"My friends,\" he said, after a moment's pause, \"will carry on without me, I am sure.\" \"I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,\" said Dumbledore.",

By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little - and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends -\"\n\"But -\"\n\"Listen to me, Harry.

Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips -\nDolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \"Now I want you to get out of -\"\nThey both ducked again.

Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more. A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses.

If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or - something else. \"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter -\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light -\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time.

His uncle's eyes flashed. \"The postman noticed,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That's why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny.\" Harry didn't say anything. Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary.

Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball - or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night. ...\n\"Why do they have to move in packs?\" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. \"How're you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?\" \"Lasso one?\"",

Times of individual appointments are listed below. Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half-past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the career information that had been left there for their perusal. \"Well, I don't fancy Healing,\" said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungo's on its front. \"It says here you need at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts.",

Just up here, I think - ouch.\" He had pointed with his injured hand. \"Professor, what happened to your - ?\" \"I have no time to explain now,\" said Dumbledore. \"It is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.\"",
            "\"Good afternoon,\" said Dumbledore, holding out his hand. Mrs. Cole simply gaped. \"My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.\" Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, \"Oh yes. Well - well then - you'd better come into my room. Yes.\"",
            "I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. \"And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone - to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. \"And the Cloak ... somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean 'invincible.' \"Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore!",
            "When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore's office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream ... it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive. ... He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them. ... He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder ... but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake ... he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead. ...\nHarry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore's office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it.",
            "\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they're - dead.\" Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \"Lily and James ... I can't believe it ... I didn't want to believe it ... Oh, Albus ...\"\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know ... I know ...\" he said heavily. Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all."

            "Harry, Blaise - any time you're passing. Same goes for you, miss,\" he twinkled at Ginny. \"Well, off you go, off you go!\" As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train. \"I'm glad that's over,\" muttered Neville.",
            "\"It is traditional,\" said Professor McGonagall firmly. \"You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.\" \"But - I don't -\"\n\"You heard me, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way. A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he'd rather have another round with the dragon. Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball - or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night. ...\n\"Why do they have to move in packs?\" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. \"How're you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?\" \"Lasso one?\"",
            "Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much food as you can. \"He hasn't come back to Hogsmeade?\" said Ron incredulously. \"It looks like it, doesn't it?\"",
            "Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself. Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them - but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes. Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms. Even Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their \"project,\" suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior. \"I will not,\" said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack.",
            "If Dudley's friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn't want to lose face in front of the gang, but he'd be terrified of provoking Harry. ... It would be really fun to watch Dudley's dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond ... and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready - he had his wand ... let them try ... He'd love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell -\nBut they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them. ... Seeking a fight was not a smart move. ... He must not use magic. ... He would be risking expulsion again. ...\nDudley's gang's voices died; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road. There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully."

            "All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell. \"Wands away,\" she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, 'Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.' There will be no need to talk.\" Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again. Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" \"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. \"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" \"I've read that too. I've read the whole book.\"",

If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort.

Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings. \"Sit, my children, sit,\" she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs.

            "Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric's Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald's next movements is that he \"traveled abroad for some months.\" It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric's Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. \"He seemed a charming boy to me,\" babbles Bathilda, \"whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.\" They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. \"Yes, even after they'd spent all day in discussion - both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire - I'd sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert's bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!\" And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore's fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend.

            "\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. \"Right.\" \"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry on tenterhooks.",
            "He'll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone's entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -\"\n\"He'd want you to tell him,\" said Hermione sternly. \"He's going to find out anyway -\"\n\"How?\" \"Harry, this isn't going to be kept quiet,\" said Hermione, very seriously. \"This tournament's famous, and you're famous. I'll be really surprised if there isn't anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. ... You're already in half the books about You-Know-Who, you know ... and Sirius would rather hear it from you, I know he would.\" \"Okay, okay, I'll write to him,\" said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake.",
            "said Ron, looking baffled. \"Was he ever inside the Lestranges' vault?\" \"I don't know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,\" said Harry. \"He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.\" Harry's scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander. \"I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he'd have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don't forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.\" Harry rubbed his scar. \"I don't think he'd have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though.",
            "He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \"Er - yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him.\" \"So you must know loads of magic already.\" The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about."

            "Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\" \"You let the troll in?\" \"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off - and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. \"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\"",
            "Just choose someone - better - next time.\" He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it. \"Well, I've chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he's better?\" asked Ginny vaguely. \"WHAT?\" shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.",
            "Harry held it up. \"Lumos!\" The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione. \"Expelliarmus!\" Hermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry's wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing ... the wand that had survived so much ...\n\"Harry,\" Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. \"I'm so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have - must have hit -\"\n\"It was an accident,\" said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned.",
            "Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday - and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.",
            "And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George's friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur's cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing \"Odo the Hero\" in a corner. Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron's who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore's obituary. Harry approached him. \"May I sit down?\""

About time too, I was getting quite - quite - Diddy, what's the matter?\" Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time.

There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing: Slughorn had just caught up. \"Harry!\"",
            "\"Hagrid did well, didn't he?\" said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. \"How come all the spells bounced off him?\" \"It'll be his giant blood,\" said Hermione shakily. \"It's very hard to Stun a giant, they're like trolls, really tough. ...

He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the entrance hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs. They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the center of them: There was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer's day. An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, Harry's Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air.",
            "\"I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?\" asked Parvati, smirking. It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning. \"Not really,\" said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet.",

After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair. \"Anything new?\" said Harry. \"Not really ...\" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages."

Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It's a lifetime of service or death.\" \"Lunch,\" said Mrs. Weasley's voice. She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip.

He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard.\" \"So they're dead?\" said Harry quietly. \"No,\" said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before. \"They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him.\"",

            "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \"What's that you've got there, Potter?\" It was Quidditch Through the Ages."

He's got the right to know what's been happen -\"\n\"Hang on!\" interrupted George loudly. \"How come Harry gets his questions answered?\" said Fred angrily.",
            "\"Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\" said Slughorn genially. Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \"Did you really tell him I'm the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\" \"Well, what's so impressive about that?\" whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \"You are the best in the year - I'd've told him so if he'd asked me!\"",
            "Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars, and candy wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione's elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard. ... But after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say. He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have? He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment. Dear Snuffles,\nHope you're okay, the first week back here's been terrible, I'm really glad it's the weekend. We've got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She's nearly as nice as your mum. I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.",

And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. ...\"\nHarry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. \"And under here, Hedwig\" - Harry pulled open a door under the stairs - \"is where I used to sleep!",
            "They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later. After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s. Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L. results. \"Herbology, fine,\" she said. \"Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with 'Exceeds Expectations.' But the problem is Transfiguration. I'm sorry, Longbottom, but an Acceptable' really isn't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T level. I just don't think you'd be able to cope with the coursework.\""

He drew out his own wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort's wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously. \"Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?\" Some of the throng sniggered. \"I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late.",

The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner. Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much. After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge. It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it. Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father's ... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.",
            "said Harry quickly. \"The Quidditch team,\" said Hermione. \"If Ginny and Dean aren't speaking ...\"\n\"Oh - oh yeah,\" said Harry. \"Flitwick,\" said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry's and Ron's were still murky brown. \"Now, now, boys,\" squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. \"A little less talk, a little more action ... Let me see you try. ...\"\nTogether they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harry's vinegar turned to ice; Ron's flask exploded.",
            "Hermione's hand was fastest once more. \"It's Polyjuice Potion, sir,\" she said. Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. \"Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here ... yes, my dear?\" said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione's hand punched the air again. \"It's Amortentia!\" \"It is indeed.",
            "\"Firs' years this way!\" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake. \"All righ', you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession. The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the chocolate, but still weak."

            "Harry took it. A large P was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy's chest on his very first day at Hogwarts. The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand. \"Did you - did you get - ?\" She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek. \"I knew it!\"",
            "\"But how did they find us?\" Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. \"How did they know where we were?\" She turned to Harry. \"You - you don't think you've still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?\" \"He can't have,\" said Ron. \"The Trace breaks at seventeen, that's Wizarding law, you can't put it on an adult.\" \"As far as you know,\" said Hermione. \"What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?\" \"But Harry hasn't been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who's supposed to have put a Trace back on him?\" Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them? \"If I can't use magic, and you can't use magic near me, without us giving away our position -\" he began. \"We're not splitting up!\" said Hermione firmly. \"We need a safe place to hide,\" said Ron.",
            "Describe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join. I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack. He could visualize a heading, in Hermione's handwriting: The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards... He had read these notes only this morning. ... He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.",
            "Price on request. Price on request ... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life - but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for the price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at the Firebolt. There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and Divination. Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window.",
            "Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read. It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absent-mindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air. Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction. After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione's mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge's eye than to struggle on with \"Basics for Beginners.\" When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer. \"Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?\""

            "He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. ... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain, really, that -\"\n\"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.",
            "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He'll have that scar forever.\" \"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\" \"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well - give him here, Hagrid - we'd better get this over with.\"",
            "Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come. \"He only gave her ten Galleons?\" said Harry indignantly. \"Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,\" said Dumbledore. \"So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo's treasured family heirlooms.\"",
            "C'mon, Harry.\" They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle. \"How dare he,\" Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. \"How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore'd do anythin' like that. Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs' place. Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he's bin lately. An' you!\" Hagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback.",
            "Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn. \"Look sharp, Tom,\" said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. \"You don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...\"\n\"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. ...\"\n\"Sir, I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes?\" And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn's voice boomed out again, just as it had done before. \"I don't know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn't tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don't let me catch you mentioning them again!\" \"Well, that's that,\" said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry."

            "Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry's head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione's sleeve. Harry's scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn't Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong.",
            "Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric's Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald's next movements is that he \"traveled abroad for some months.\" It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric's Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. \"He seemed a charming boy to me,\" babbles Bathilda, \"whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.\" They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. \"Yes, even after they'd spent all day in discussion - both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire - I'd sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert's bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!\" And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore's fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.)",
            "Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves. The knowledge that they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturday's meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ... and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done ... and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament. ... The knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes. He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together, discussing Angelina's idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night's Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people. A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board, so large that it covered everything else on there - the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys' new advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-and-found notices.",

Maybe go easy on the drink ...\"\n\"A team of Healers from St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,\" said Scrimgeour. \"I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.\" \"I ... well ... He'll be all right, won't he?\""

You've seen how it is, you won't get anything like a fair hearing here.\" \"Harry,\" said Hermione, \"how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?\" \"Patronuses,\" said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door.",
            "He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him -\"\n\"Imagine that,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly. \"I doubt,\" said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's conversation, \"that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger.

Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew. ...\"\nHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she -\"\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful. \"Harry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -\"\n\"Voldemort?\"",
            "Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest; he did not want to say good-bye to Sirius. He had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid - Harry was worried that Snape's accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place. Before he could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned him to his side. \"I want you to take this,\" he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry's hands. \"What is it?\" Harry asked.",

Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore's throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore's eyelids fluttered and opened. \"Why,\" said Snape, without preamble, \"why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?\" Marvolo Gaunt's ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. Dumbledore grimaced."

The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely. \"Take this thing for a walk?\" he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes. \"And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash?",

He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog's head, and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning. \"Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,\" said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. \"Boy and girl from each.\" \"And guess who's a Slytherin prefect?\" said Ron, still with his eyes closed. \"Malfoy,\" replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.\n\" 'Course,\" said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another. \"And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,\" said Hermione viciously. \"How she got to be a prefect when she's thicker than a concussed troll ...\"\n\"Who's Hufflepuff?\" Harry asked. \"Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,\" said Ron thickly. \"And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,\" said Hermione. \"You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,\" said a vague voice.",

Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started. \"Had a good Christmas?\" he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, \"I've been doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After the last match, you know. If the dementors come to the next one ...

Out on the field with only your team members, it's very exposed, Potter -\"\n\"We've got our first match on Saturday!\" said Harry, outraged. \"I've got to train, Professor!\" Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, after all, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited, holding his breath. \"Hmm ...\" Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. \"Well ... goodness knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last ... but all the same, Potter ... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.\" The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch.

As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. \"We have already placed protection around the castle,\" Professor McGonagall was saying, \"but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it.

Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him. \"Wonder where his mummy is?\" said Harry, frowning. \"Given her the slip by the looks of it,\" said Ron. \"Why, though?\" said Hermione. Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent. He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street. \"Get under here, quick,\" said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \"Oh - I don't know, Harry,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley. \"Come on!\" said Ron.

Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words \"Accio Wand!\" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.

Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemort's; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry. \"And I don't know how you stand it, it's horrible,\" she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort. It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers' voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet's version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them, the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year. It was not only the students' mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching. \"They obviously can't talk freely in the staffroom anymore,\" said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry, and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day. \"Not with Umbridge there.\" \"Reckon they know anything new?\" said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers. \"If they do, we're not going to hear about it, are we?\""

            "Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him. Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation. He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans ... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly:\n\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier.",
            "\"Yes ... for homework,\" said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, \"practice.\" They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, \"It's a nice day.\" Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry's brain:\nShe's Ron's sister. But she's ditched Dean!",
            "\"Ah, Potter,\" said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them. \"Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,\" said Snape softly. \"They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.\" \"Right, Professor,\" said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables. \"I thought you could start,\" said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, \"with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see ...\"\nHe pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, \" 'James Potter and Sirius Black.",
            "He transformed back into the great black dog and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing. When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream. \"Harry! Oh Harry!\" She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them. \"Molly,\" he said, holding up a hand, \"please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,\" he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, \"you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.\"",
            "\"I've spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can't just ignore it all!\" But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its mind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had been noticeably subdued since Gryffindor's triumph in the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his old swagger over the next few days. From sneering comments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about. It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these occasions. And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid, because the strict new security measures had not been lifted, and Harry didn't dare retrieve his Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch. * * *\nExam week began and an unnatural hush fell over the castle. The third years emerged from Transfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the difficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had included turning a teapot into a tortoise."

        [
            "\"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, \"STUPEFY!\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada -\"\nHarry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, \"EXPELLIARMUS!\" Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, \"STUPEFY!\" The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses.",
            "There was no time to relax that night - they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for Transfiguration next day. Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories. He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall. They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall. \"Oh bravo!\" cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. \"Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter ... unless ...\"\nHe leaned forward a little.",
            "Harry's feet touched road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing - and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened. The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street, their wands aloft. Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their position. One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. \"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters. Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. \"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm, and then to his fellows, \"Spread out.",
            "Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know -\"\n\"- some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order -\" said Hermione. \"- and some of them are standing guard over something,\" said Ron. \"They're always talking about guard duty.\"",
            "Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. \"Only one wand, I think,\" he whispered. \"And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn't he?\" asked Harry. \"I - how?\" croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. \"How do you know this?\""

            "... Weird place to have a weapon ...\"\n\"It's not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,\" said Hermione. \"It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect. ... Harry, are you sure you're all right?\" For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it. \"Yeah ... fine ...\" he said, lowering his hands, which were trembling. \"I just feel a bit ... I don't like Occlumency much. ...\"\n\"I expect anyone would feel shaky if they'd had their mind attacked over and over again,\" said Hermione sympathetically. \"Look, let's get back to the common room, we'll be a bit more comfortable there.",
            "Pigwidgeon's back!\" Ron's tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, \"Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn't he cute?\" \"Stupid little feathery git!\" Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. \"You bring letters to the addressee! You don't hang around showing off!\"",
            "You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson -\"\nHarry had been edging around the fountain on the other side. She screamed, \"Crucio!\" and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur's arm, holding its bow, spun off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard's head. \"Potter, you cannot win against me!\"",
            "Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon's drills. \"This Potter,\" said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did?\" Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. \"He - didn't work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed.\" \"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who -\"\n\"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet.",
            "Hope the Muggles are treating you right. All the best,\nHagrid\nIt struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's, grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from Hogwarts left. Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:\nDear Mr. Potter,\nPlease note that the new school year will begin on September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leave from King's Cross station, platform nine and three-quarters, at eleven o'clock. Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign. A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,\nProfessor M. McGonagall\nDeputy Headmistress\nHarry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there."

            "Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle. Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over - a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness. Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs. \"What's the matter?\" said Ron. Harry pointed.",

The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone. Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.",
            "She drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna's hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey. \"When you're ready,\" she said, \"we're going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.\" \"We'll be there in a bit,\" Harry assured her. \"Ron's just got to have some breakfast.\" It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione got up too, and taking Harry's arm, she drew him to one side. \"Don't let Ron see what's on those Slytherins' badges,\" she whispered urgently. Harry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate. \"Good luck, Ron,\" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek. \"And you, Harry -\"\nRon seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched onto them:\nWEASLEY\nIS OUR KING\nWith an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he hurried Ron across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air. The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns toward the stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron was listening. Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch. \"Okay, I've only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin,\" said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment.",

Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless.

I'm leaving the Dursleys. He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: \"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!\" Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death."

Karkaroff doesn't strike me as the type who'd go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and I can't help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident.\" \"Looks like a really good plan from where I'm standing,\" said Harry grinning bleakly. \"They'll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.\" \"Right - these dragons,\" said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. \"There's a way, Harry.",

Then she drew herself up to her fullest height. \"We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this - this object.\" \"Is that possible?\" \"I think so,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly, \"we teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape -\"\n\"Let me -\"\n\"- and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds -\"\n\"There's a way,\" said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog's Head. \"Potter, we're talking about hundreds of students -\"\n\"I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of the Hog's Head.\"",

Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick's fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas. \"At this rate, we'll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it's going to be.\"",
            "I'll bet all the change is at the bottom,\" sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death Eaters' spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron's head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, \"Stupefy!\" The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot - the waitress screamed and ran for the door - Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door."

            "Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys' affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has \"never felt this way about any other girl.\" However, it might not be Miss Granger's doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys' interest. \"She's really ugly,\" says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth-year student, \"but she'd be well up to making a Love Potion, she's quite brainy. I think that's how she's doing it.\" Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter's well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate. \"I told you!\" Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. \"I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter!",

We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a basilisk in there.\" Because Harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart's office. There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart's eyes peering through it.",
            "He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape's desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict. Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted. \"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire. \"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously. Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. \"- so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn't get on the train.\" \"Why didn't you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\" Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry. Harry gaped at her. Now she'd said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done. \"I - I didn't think -\"\n\"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\" There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it.",
            "In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin. \"Look at the state of his robes,\" Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. \"He dresses like our old house-elf.\" But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds. Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes."

He's getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day.

            "Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. ...\n\"Professor Snape discovered,\" Dumbledore resumed, \"that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant. \"And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along - that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing himself at last - or else you would have to take it for him. It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.\" \"But I didn't,\" muttered Harry.",
            "\"Ah, but of course 'e is lying!\" cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling. \"He could not have crossed the Age Line,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. \"I am sure we are all agreed on that -\"\n\"Dumbly-dorr must 'ave made a mistake wiz ze line,\" said Madame Maxime, shrugging. \"It is possible, of course,\" said Dumbledore politely\n\"Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!\" said Professor McGonagall angrily. \"Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I'm sure that should be good enough for everybody else!\" She shot a very angry look at Professor Snape. \"Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Bagman,\" said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, \"you are our - er - objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular?\" Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice. \"We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.\" \"Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,\" said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.",
            "\"Give me Harry Potter,\" said Voldemort's voice, \"and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. \"You have until midnight.\" The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, \"But he's there! Potter's there!",
            "The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right - the rest of the school must already be here - but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall."

The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back. The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well. Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.",
            "Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again. \"Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,\" he said, bowing to her. \"Now - as I was saying, Quidditch tryouts will be held ...\"\n\"Yes, it certainly was illuminating,\" said Hermione in a low voice. \"You're not telling me you enjoyed it?\" Ron said quietly, turning a glazed face upon Hermione. \"That was about the dullest speech I've ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.\" \"I said illuminating, not enjoyable,\" said Hermione. \"It explained a lot.\" \"Did it?\" said Harry in surprise. \"Sounded like a load of waffle to me.\" \"There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,\" said Hermione grimly.",
            "Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\" Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.",
            "Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand? \"And as for this book,\" said Hermione, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I've never even heard of them!\" \"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?\" said Ron incredulously. \"You're kidding, right?\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione in surprise. \"Do you know them, then?\" \"Well, of course I do!\" Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. \"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's, aren't they? 'The Fountain of Fair Fortune' ... 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot' ... 'Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump' ...\"\n\"Excuse me?\" said Hermione, giggling."

Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle's mind, laid Morfin's wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.\" \"And Morfin never realized he hadn't done it?\" \"Never,\" said Dumbledore. \"He gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.\" \"But he had this real memory in him all the time!\" \"Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,\" said Dumbledore, \"and why should anybody delve further into Morfin's mind when he had already confessed to the crime?

As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, \"CHARGE!\" \"Harry, you get the Cloak on,\" said Hermione. \"Never mind us -\"\nBut he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells. They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \"Wheeeeeeeeeeee!\" and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. \"Argh!\" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose.",
            "Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful. To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term. \"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!\" said Hermione. \"Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!\" Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own.",
            "Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur's father. \"I like this song,\" said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms. \"She's great, isn't she?\" said Ron admiringly. \"Always good value.\" But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna's vacant seat.",

Why didn't he just let him die?\" \"I dunno - maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out -\"\n\"What d'you think, Sirius?\" Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen. \"I think they've both got a point,\" said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \"Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I've wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,\" Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\" Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names. \"Rosier and Wilkes - they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges - they're a married couple - they're in Azkaban. Avery - from what I've heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he'd been acting under the Imperius Curse - he's still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater - not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape's certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\" \"Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\" said Ron. \"Yeah, you should've seen Snape's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\" said Harry quickly. \"Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape's been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn't see what it was.\" \"He showed Snape something on his arm?\" said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \"Well, I've no idea what that's about ... but if Karkaroff's genuinely worried, and he's going to Snape for answers ...\"\nSirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration. \"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort.\" \"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape's office then?\" said Ron stubbornly. \"Well,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I wouldn't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though ... he's a different matter ... is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not ... what's he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box? What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?\" Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall."

No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness - but, as I say, you'll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken.\" Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? \"He had brains,\" she concedes, \"although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers.\" But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? \"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,\" says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. \"I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell - or perhaps a Dungbomb.

Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.\" \"So why aren' you checkin' me?\" panted Hagrid, still struggling to fit through the door. \"You're half-giant,\" said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. \"The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.\"",
            "They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn't they? Someone set off the Dark Mark ... and then - did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who's gone missing?\" \"Bertha Jorkins?\" said Harry. \"Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that's definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn't she?\" \"Yeah, but ... it's not very likely she'd have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?\" said Harry. \"Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,\" said Sirius grimly. \"She was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It's not a good combination, Harry. I'd say she'd be very easy to lure into a trap. \"So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?\" said Harry.",
            "Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\" \" 'Extinct in the male line'?\" repeated Ron. \"It means the name's died out,\" said Hermione, \"centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they'd just be called something different.\" And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \"Peverell\": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \"Marvolo Gaunt!\" \"Sorry?\" said Ron and Hermione together. \"Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who's grandfather!",
            "\"We know the snake's not in Albania, it's usually with Vol -\"\n\"Didn't I ask you to stop saying that?\" \"Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who - happy?\" \"Not particularly.\" \"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,\" said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \"Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway.\" Ron yawned pointedly.",
            "How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory? In living memory ... Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs."

            "\"Potter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?\" Professor McGonagall's irritated voice cracked like a whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up. It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall's desk (Neville's still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (\"Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches\"). The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock. \"Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,\" said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor - Ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before - \"I have something to say to you all. \"The Yule Ball is approaching - a traditional part of the Tri-wizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above - although you may invite a younger student if you wish -\"\nLavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron. \"Dress robes will be worn,\" Professor McGonagall continued, \"and the ball will start at eight o'clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall. Now then -\"\nProfessor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.",
            "Now then ... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.\" Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again. \"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\"",
            "Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry's spirits soared: The thought of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred by Harry's guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs. Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother's old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher. Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A. meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry's face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS! Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy as always. \"Hello,\" she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. \"These are nice, did you put them up?\" \"No,\" said Harry, \"it was Dobby the house-elf.\" \"Mistletoe,\" said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry's head.",
            "\"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable -\"\nSomeone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. \"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest.",
            "If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse - people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert."

Harry knew perfectly well they'd just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn't squashed him flat. Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape's desk.",
            "\"Aggiden.\" \"Accident?\" There was more jeering laughter. \"You know who used to like using the Dark Lord's name, Weasley?\" growled Greyback. \"The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?\" \"Doh.\" \"Well, they don't show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name's been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We'll see.",
            "\"Our short-term aims,\" said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, \"are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly underrepresented.\" \"And how do we do all this?\" Harry asked. \"We start by recruiting members,\" said Hermione happily. \"I thought two Sickles to join - that buys a badge - and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign.",
            "Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile. \"He's bitter.\"",
            "\"Zey are very strong. ...\"\n\"I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"Very well,\" said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. \"Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?\" \"It will be attended to,\" said Dumbledore, also bowing. \"Come,\" said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps."

            "A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look. Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever.",
            "\"Come off it!\" said Ron. \"You've been off with Dumbledore!\" \"It wasn't that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name's Horace Slughorn.\" \"Oh,\" said Ron, looking disappointed.",
            "said Harry quickly. \"The Quidditch team,\" said Hermione. \"If Ginny and Dean aren't speaking ...\"\n\"Oh - oh yeah,\" said Harry. \"Flitwick,\" said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry's and Ron's were still murky brown. \"Now, now, boys,\" squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. \"A little less talk, a little more action ... Let me see you try. ...\"\nTogether they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harry's vinegar turned to ice; Ron's flask exploded.",
            "He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" A magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.",
            "...\nRon and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare. \"Don't worry about it,\" Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them and said he didn't mind practicing on his own for a while, \"at least we'll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd never have found out about all these hexes in class.\" \"Good training for when we're all Aurors,\" said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair. The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again. Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead. Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school, Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione's that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx."

The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. \"Don't do that.\" Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There's an owl -\"\n\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \"What?\" \"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper.

The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat. \"Don't do that.\" Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There's an owl -\"\n\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \"What?\" \"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets.\" Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets - bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.",
            "\"Professor,\" Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, \"Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\" \"- Protego Horribilis - the diadem of Ravenclaw?\" squeaked Flitwick. \"A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!\" \"I only meant - do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?\" \"Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy!\" Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? \"We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!\"",
            "of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone. \"Excellent!\" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause. \"Excellent, Neville. Well done, everyone. ... Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart - ten for Neville because he did it twice ... and five each to Hermione and Harry.\" \"But I didn't do anything,\" said Harry. \"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,\" Lupin said lightly. \"Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me ... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\" Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom."

When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master ... of returning to his service.\" \"How did your father subdue you?\" said Dumbledore. \"The Imperius Curse,\" Crouch said. \"I was under my father's control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior.\"",
            "\"YOU SEE?\" roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry's direction. \"A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you -\"\n\"The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,\" said Dumbledore. \"I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.\" \"I - not - I haven't got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that's not the only - he blew up his aunt, for God's sake!\" Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge's bench and upsetting a bottle of ink. \"And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,\" said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes. \"And I haven't even started on what he gets up to at school -\"\n\"- but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, Harry's behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,\" said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words. \"Oho!\" said Fudge. \"Not our business what he does at school, eh? You think so?\"",
            "Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.\" \"Well then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?\" Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so. \"The usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable - when you are asleep, for instance - you are sharing the Dark Lord's thoughts and emotions. The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue. He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.\" Harry's heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up. \"But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?\" he asked abruptly. \"I don't like it much, but it's been useful, hasn't it?",
            "\"You are forgetting ... you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring.",
            "The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man - cruel ... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there's no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You'd have thought he was merely bored - asked if I'd finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him - and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night.\""

He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix's wand had been stolen. \"Act now, act now,\" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, \"the Imperius Curse!\" Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, \"Imperio!\" A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, \"Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\" \"What?\" said Hermione. \"No, no, that's mine -\"\n\"A new wand?\" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. \"But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\" Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \"Imperio!\" once more. \"Oh yes, I see,\" said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, \"yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't you?\" Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment. The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached. \"I shall need the Clankers,\" he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. \"Good, good!",
            "Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. \"Fascinating!\" he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.\" Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun.",
            "Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened. \"I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless they have achieved 'Exceeds Expectations' or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging 'Acceptable' at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,\" she added, with the merest flicker of a smile.",
            "Potter!\" sang Professor Umbridge. Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned away from him again, but now several other people had their hands up too. \"And your name is?\" Professor Umbridge said to Dean. \"Dean Thomas.\" \"Well, Mr. Thomas?\" \"Well, it's like Harry said, isn't it?\" said Dean. \"If we're going to be attacked, it won't be risk-free -\"\n\"I repeat,\" said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, \"do you expect to be attacked during my classes?\" \"No, but -\"\nProfessor Umbridge talked over him. \"I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school,\" she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, \"but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed - not to mention,\" she gave a nasty little laugh, \"extremely dangerous half-breeds.\" \"If you mean Professor Lupin,\" piped up Dean Thomas angrily, \"he was the best we ever -\"\n\"Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying - you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day -\"\n\"No we haven't,\" Hermione said, \"we just -\"\n\"Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!\" Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from her. \"It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you -\"\n\"Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn't he?\""

A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer.

I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.\" \"And why may I not have the same information?\" \"I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.\"",
            "\"What made you leave, Ted?\" continued the man. \"Knew they were coming for me,\" replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks's father. \"Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I'd better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I'd have to leave in the end.",
            "\"What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort. \"Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother's sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. ... But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all. \"Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know.",
            "\"Trying to find out whether you'd been expelled or not. I'll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy's been talking to Fudge again.\" \"What private business have they got together anyway?\" \"Gold, I expect,\" said Mr. Weasley angrily. \"Malfoy's been giving generously to all sorts of things for years. ... Gets him in with the right people ... then he can ask favors ... delay laws he doesn't want passed ... Oh, he's very well connected, Lucius Malfoy.",
            "Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon's cage to muffle his hooting. \"Bagman wanted to tell us what's happening at Hogwarts,\" he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. \"At the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won't say. Wonder what -\"\n\"Shh!\" Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs.

Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time. \"They're definitely owls,\" said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window. \"And there are three of them,\" said Harry, hastening to her other side. \"One for each of us,\" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ...\"\nShe gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows. The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope. \"Oh no!\" squealed Hermione. Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs. Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Hermione's hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.",

He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where \"chivalry\" entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione's wand at the ice. \"Diffindo.\"",
            "\"This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art - it's a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. ... If he didn't do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.\" \"Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he'd already read that?\" asked Ron.",
            "\"Dumbledore reckons You-Know-Who's getting stronger again as well?\" Ron whispered. Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione - and, of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore's office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry's mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off. Ron stared into the common room fire.",
            "Hermione hissed. \"He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to know!\" \"He can't be getting in through a passage,\" said Harry quickly. \"There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the other three - one of them's caved in, so no one can get through it. One of them's got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it. And the one I just came through - well - it's really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there ...\"\nHarry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage was there? Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door. - BY ORDER OF -\nTHE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\nCustomers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall. Merry Christmas! \"See?\" said Ron quietly.",
            "He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus ...\"\n\"If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn't you?\" \"I admit that was my intention,\" said Dumbledore, \"but it did not work as I intended, did it?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"That bit didn't work out.\" The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow. \"I've got to go back, haven't I?\" \"That is up to you.\" \"I've got a choice?\" \"Oh yes.\" Dumbledore smiled at him. \"We are in King's Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to ... let's say ... board a train.\""

All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they're raided, and you need a password to tune in.",

He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light. He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower."

            "The wind and rain lashed at the building. \"You've got to tell someone,\" said Ron. \"I told Sirius last time.\" \"Well, tell him about this time!\" \"Can't, can I?\" said Harry grimly. \"Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember?\" \"Well then, Dumbledore -\"\n\"I've just told you, he already knows,\" said Harry shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, and swinging it around himself. \"There's no point telling him again.\"",
            "The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of his arm. \"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. \"It's all a matter of confidence, Harry.\" He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it. \"There's this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they're raided, and you need a password to tune in.",
            "There were lights on in Hagrid's windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence. Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light. He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower."

            "I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!\" Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up -\n\"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession - no! - Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field - THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\"",
            "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. Professor M. McGonagall\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I've never even touched one.\"",
            "\"Erm - Harry - could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They'll be really pleased - I mean, prefect is something they can understand -\"\n\"Yeah, no problem,\" said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. \"Take her!\" He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings. He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hedwig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe. He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way toward certain people. But if he had remembered ... if he had thought about it ... what would he have expected? Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.",
            "Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass. She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry's face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see. The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly. \"Bathilda?\" Harry repeated. She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room. \"Harry, I'm not sure about this,\" breathed Hermione. \"Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,\" said Harry. \"Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn't all there. Muriel called her 'gaga.'",
            "Dumbledore smiled. \"I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.\" Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore's cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, \"The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius's recent failures. Slow torture for Draco's parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.\" \"In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,\" said Dumbledore. \"Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?\" There was a short pause. \"That, I think, is the Dark Lord's plan.\" \"Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?\" \"He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.\" \"And if it does fall into his grasp,\" said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, \"I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?\" Snape gave a stiff nod. \"Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to."

Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries. The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry's mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.

He was still checking the Marauder's Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless. A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder's Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy's tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys' bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle. Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.

As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. \"A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,\" Umbridge was saying. \"Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core.

Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping. \"It is back,\" he said softly, \"they will all have noticed it ... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...\"\nHe pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm.

An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry's brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney's fire. \"I haven't got a clue what this lot's supposed to mean,\" he said, staring down at a long list of calculations.",

He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho's face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before ... and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric's shadowy, stubborn face. \"Both of us,\" Harry said. \"What?\" \"We'll take it at the same time. It's still a Hogwarts victory. We'll tie for it.\""

Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the man's mouth open and poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the man's chest and said, \"Rennervate.\" Crouch's son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused."

            "... He's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in ... um ... complementary medicine. ... I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies ... well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds -\"\nMrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning. \"Do you mean to tell me,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, \"that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?\"",
            "\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\" The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git''\n\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.\"",

She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort's mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dumbledore, bowing his head. \"So ... are you still looking for them, sir?

In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who's fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid's own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who's supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants. Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open."

He stood up and pressed his ear against the door. \"Doesn't sound like anyone's there. ... Come on, let's go.",
            "Hermione's explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.

            "She was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming. \"Why don't you just do it yourself?\" he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering. Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic locomotion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around the edge of the table. Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day.",
            "They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:\nMessrs.

But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else. This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead -\n\"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\" - he pointed them out - \"but we're sure we're the only ones who know about these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it's caved in - completely blocked.",
            "\"Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!\" \"But - how will that help Sirius?\" \"Dumbledore said - he just told us where the window is - the window of Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak - they can escape together!\" From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified. \"If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!\" \"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?\" said Harry.
