What've they gotta do - fight 'em?\" \"Just get past them, I think,\" said Charlie. \"We'll be on hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don't know why ... but I tell you this, I don't envy the one who gets the Horntail.",

When they had said good-bye, Sirius's face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair - but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius's face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters' wedding. \"Never mind me, how are you?\" said Sirius seriously. \"I'm -\" For a second, Harry tried to say \"fine\" - but he couldn't do it. Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he'd talked in days - about how no one believed he hadn't entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn't walk down a corridor without being sneered at - and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron's jealousy ...\n\"... and now Hagrid's just shown me what's coming in the first task, and it's dragons, Sirius, and I'm a goner,\" he finished desperately.",

Just something to scare Snape.\" Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board. \"Before we go any farther, I think we'd better check,\" whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, \"Homenum revelio.\" Nothing happened. \"Well, you've just had a big shock,\" said Ron kindly. \"What was that supposed to do?\" \"It did what I meant it to do!\"",

For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard. It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless - discuss.\" The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read:\nNon-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation.",
